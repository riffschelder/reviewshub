        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "This phone is almost completely awesome. When I say Almost, it's because there are a few things I miss about webOS. I previously had an HP pre 2. The main thing I miss is pre-dialing. webOS has a pre-dial feature which lets you set what to pre dial if you dial less than 7 numbers.\nBut enough about that.\nThis phone is so awesome, there are now 3 of them in my household.\nThings I like:\nSwipe shortcuts on the lock screen. These are customizeable and allow you to launch things like the dialer, camera, etc. as you unlock it.\nBig Screen. Some people are put off by the 5 inch screen, but as an aging myopic, I love it.\nAdditional storage and removable battery rank high with me.\nI can't believe it's considered \"aging\" but newer phones are already out. The Note II and various droids now have quad cores or faster cores, but this is quite good. [Verizon SGS3 have a dual core.]\n2GB RAM is great too. regardless, this phone is so good and so much better than most phones that are out, I don't think anyone will be disappointed with it.\nWith all it has, you would expect it to be heavy. It's not! Even inside its otterbox it is very light.\n\nThe case isn't so great. But I don't care because I don't carry it undressed. I carry it in an Otterbox Defender Case all of the time and recommend it.\n\nI bet you think I recommend this phone. Well, you're right. It's so easy to use and feature rich, I recommend it to anyone. Don't judge it's size too quickly.",

One night I recorded a video of my dog on my phone and while I was watching the playback I noticed a new icon on the top of the screen labeled \"send to other device\". I pressed the icon and the video on my phone appeared on my TV in full 1080P. It looked fantastic and it was so seamless. I also found this icon appeared for pictures also. Samsung also has software on the phone called Kies. It allows complete and total access to your smartphone though any web browser on your local network. It allowed me to copy video and pictures to my smartphone wirelessly. You can also download the Kies software to your PC from Samsung and it looks and works just like iTunes.",

I have learned most of the things I need thanks to youtube since it doesn't come with a hard copy of a manual. The manual in the phone doesn't really cover much. Battery life isn't bad for what I need but I'm not on the internet much but I had to get the data plan to get the phone. I have had no problems with freezing or other glitches. I would definitely recommend a case for this phone since its kind of slippery to hold. Great phone!",

On my old phone (Samsung Galaxy), I never had any problems whatsovever with that feature so that is quite bothersome particularly with a phone that is supposed to be an upgrade.",

        "comment": "I didn't think there would be a faster or better android phone than the Note. I got this this afternoon. Cut down my Sim to a micro...stuck it in and zoom. Quadrant was 5476. ICS is so fluid and easy. TouchWiz is amazing also. This is quad core and it is hard to keep up with. The only thing I have noticed so far is when you push the home button it really seems to lag to get back to the home screen. Maybe haven't tuned up all the settings though. I played with the One X at ATT. The real difference is the sound on the SIII is LOUD and clear. Plus, the fact of having an SD card and replaceable battery was the no brainer decision for me. The only other real problem with this and the One X is that in six months, or less, they will be outdated. Oh Yes, S Voice takes longer than Siri, but the replies seem to in more detail. Get it if you are an android fan and you will positively enjoy it.",

The camera is amazing, the resolution is amazing, the images and videos are crisp in HD, screen size is perfect and fits in my skinny jeans (i'm a guy), it's running on Android OS so you can customize everything about the phone, and this phone is extremely fast.\n\nHowever, there is one major flaw. As the S3 has the ability to run so many things as compared to the iPhone, it eventually takes it toll. After a year with my S3, the OS starts to get choppy and laggy, and texting becomes troublesome as the OS would not recognize your touch response without a .5 second lag.\n\nThe pros definitely out weigh the cons. However, if you're looking for an average phone with a high price point, get the iPhone. If you want a unique phone with above average quality, go for the S3.",

It's also the first phone I've had without a slide-out keyboard. I'm still adjusting to that.\nOverall - I am very please with the phone and I couldn't beat the price!",

The phone is a bit large, but it makes perfect sense for the on-screen keyboard. The battery depletes quickly, but a free app called \"Juice Defender\" will allow the battery to last 1-2 days before needing a charge.

My favorite feature on the phone is s beam. You can basically send anything to another phone by tapping it. A lot of people have been impressed with my phone. I convinced a friend to buy one and he loves it. My family are all iPhone users and I've converted my mom and brother.",

Both offered potential full day use without recharging. My son owns the Motorola and has no issues with it. Since they are equally raved about, my decision points were cost - the Samsung being $100 cheaper - and battery configuration. If need be, the battery in the Samsung can be replaced by the owner, or pulled if a hard reboot becomes necessary. The Motorola does not have a removable battery. I've had the phone for 2 months and so far have no complaints. It does everything I want, and more, and I never worry now about running down the battery. An added plus is the speed of downloads. This phone operates on the 4G Verizon network and is very quick compared to my older phone.",

I made it more than 2.5 years on my last smartphone, and was planning to hold out a bit longer until I saw that the price on the S3 had been dramatically reduced (to $50) prior to the release of the S4. Since I have a Galaxy Tab, I figured the S3 would be similar in terms of configuration and layout, which it was. The S3 is far superior to my old smartphone (a Motorola Droid 2) in every way (except battery life) and is beautiful to behold. Blazingly fast, crisp display, gorgeous screen....what's not to love? I don't need or use all the bells and whistles (e.g., NFC, Allshare, etc), but can still appreciate the various additions that have made this phone a contender for the top spot in the market.",

I tend to use my phone for picture taking more than my camera. Still not sure how to add apps. Others have done it for me.",

So much better than the phone I had before, I can finally enjoy a phone and not want to throw it out the window as I'm driving. Would recommend this to anyone who is willing to listen.",

        "comment": "After lugging around a 15-inch MacBook Pro for work, my shoulders needed a break. I switched to the 11-inch 2012 MacBook Air and while I enjoyed the notebook's portable form factor, I missed having a built-in card reader and needed something with more storage and a little more screen real estate.\n\nOnce Apple announced its refreshed MacBook Airs, I quickly set my sights on the 13-inch model due to the fact that it retained its predecessor's solid build quality, while drastically improving its performance and battery life.\n\nThe 2013 Air sports a fourth-generation Intel Haswell processor, which gives the new 13-inch MacBook Air 12 hours of battery life. While it may sound like a marketing gimmick, the updated Air delivers on this claim. In fact, its battery can easily exceed 12 hours of work.\n\nArguably the second big draw for the updated MacBook Air is its improved flash memory, which Apple claims is over 40 percent better than last year's model. Boot times were noticeably quicker and data reads and writes are considerably faster.\n\nAside from the aforementioned highlights, the 2013 13-inch MacBook Air's biggest shortcoming is its display. It's not terrible, but in a market saturated with high-res displays, the Air's screen is easily outclassed by many of its competitors.\n\nThat being said, if you're not the type to obsess over pixel density and you're looking for a solid machine that will get you through a day at the office or classroom, the 2013 MacBook Air is definitely a worthy contender.",

        "comment": "I love this phone. My wife has an iPhone and I had an iTouch along with a regular (nonsmart) phone. I just liked the iPhone and apple OS but it was boring and conventional; its something you just get accustomed to . I had a difficult time typing/texting with my larger hands/fingers on the iPhone so when I held the store demo Galaxy phone, it felt very comfortable in my hands and was a perfect size. The screen is much larger while the phone is very light and thin, fitting easily in a pocket or purse.\nThe Android OS is very intuitive and does everything you could possible want it to do, better than the iPhone in my opinion. As someone that really uses numerous features of a device, the Galaxy provides just that and beyond. I even found the calendar and contacts to be much better than the very simple, plain looking app native to the iPhone.\nI do have to admit, Apple has a better looking music program than the Galaxy, however the galaxy plays music with great clarity and ease, its just a very basic looking program, not a big deal honestly. There's no Facetime but Skype is available.\nAs a tech enthusiast I highly recommend this phone. Its intuitive enough for the casual user but even more rewarding in the hands of someone that is tech savvy. Voice commands work better than Apple's, customization is vast, just keep a charger handy and turn off background activity as it will drain your battery quickly. Take the time to do this as it will double your battery life. Buy this phone!",

The thing I like best about it is that I can have my music my pictures everything on this phone and I have plenty of cloud storage is well. So I never run out of storage space on this phone. I also like the can be used as a GPS device. It makes it very easy to figure out how to get around places you've never been before. The text to talk and talk to text is also very good as well. It's especially good for when you're creating long text messages or writing reviews. I also like the share feature where you can just bump phones with another galaxy 3 and everything automatically goes. It's a little bit hard to figure it out at first or to figure out exactly how to get it to click together right but once you figure that out it's very easy to do and you can share nearly anything.",

The least intuitive was actually dialing the phone and answering the phone. There may be short-cuts I'm not aware of, but it just seems a hassle to dial someone and look for them in contacts. Also, answering doesn't seem as easy with the swipe. Everything else seemed really good.",

The display is crystal clear, it's got a great camera, and the 4G speed is unbelievable sometimes. Most times it's a 1 charge a day type phone, but there are times where it drains quickly and you have to give it a quick charge in the middle of the day. Compared to my last phone though, this phone's battery is 5-10x's better. I would easily recommend this phone.",

        "comment": "This is my first \"Smart Phone\" and I'm not a very techie person so I need very clear and concise operating instructions. The Start Here guide which comes with the phone just kind of points you in a direction to use apps on the phone. I went on line and printed off the Users Guide which is has detailed instructions for using the phone. However, I did find the instructions in the manual may not be exactly the way an app works. You're then on your own to figure it out. The volume on my phone, even though set to the highest setting isn't loud. In a quiet space it can be heard but in a noisy environment I miss all the calls. Using the phone outside in the sunlight is almost impossible. The screen can't be seen in the sunlight. You'll need to move to a shaded area which helps a little to see the screen. When composing a text message the phone limits your text in characters that can be entered. If you exceed the amount of allowable entered characters your text is wiped out and you'll need to start over again. The speaker feature for composing a text is very helpful. Just need to check your text for correct spelling before sending. Other then these above mentioned issues the more I get to know how to use the phone it is quite impressive. I would recommend this phone to other people and when I'm ready for another phone I would certainly consider purchasing the newest model of this phone.",

Good display (size and quality). Battery life was better than a previous Samsung phone. My only isues are that the ringer and notification sounds are two different settings and Verizon has too many apps pre-loaded. Also the Play Music app is always running. I dont use it much and hate they it is aways running in the background.",

My daughter got the iphone 5 at the same time and even she is always wanting to use my phone. You just have to decide which brand you prefer. I use this phone in my truck for music and making calls on my Bluetooth which is connected to my stereo. This makes for great hands free talking and have not had one dropped call since I got the phone. I do live In an area that tends to have weak cell signals but I have not had one problem. I have sent over 9000 text and not a single issue. Also over 7000 minutes in actual phone calls and not one dropped call. This is an AMAZING phone.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I've had a Dell laptop for about 4 years and also had a Dell Desktop. Wanted to switch over to Mac, as many friends who owned PCs had told me that the new Windows 8 operating system was a bit weird and unmanageable. The only thing I worried about was the Wifi issues that many people had complained about. At first, I was hesitant to go for the Air, and wanted to try the pro instead, however the pro with retina was about 400 dollars more expensive at the time, and also was a bit heavier than the air. Since I am starting out in the fall as a college student, I wanted a super light weight portable laptop that I could carry around without having to worry about breaking.\nDespite the many reviews about the Wifi having issues, I splurged and bought it. I have had no issues with ANY Wifi connections so far, and the internet moves faster than my old PC even though they are connected to the same Wifi. Overall, the laptop is super easy to use, even for beginners, and if you have an iPhone or an iPad, you can do SO much with both devices. I can talk to my friends via iMessage not only on my iPhone now, but also on my Macbook and email notifications are so much easier. Before, I used to have to open Chrome/Internet and then login to my email every time. Now, everything is within a simple click on the dock, and all the apps are within easy reach. Although the Mac is very different from the PC, it didn't take me too long to get used to using OS operating system. Everything is super easy and fast, and setup took only a few minutes.\nAlso, the battery life is indeed amazing. Apple promised 12 hours of battery life on the new Air, and although I have not kept track of my usage hours, I have to say that it is a pretty strong battery life. On my Dell pc, I could barely go 2 hours without having to plug it in. I have used my new Macbook Air for about 5 days now, and only had to charge it once. It was only charged for a little amount of time before the battery was full. Also, when I shut down the Air, and leave it off for a few days, the battery life remains the same. As for the Dell, I would charge it 100% and turn it off, but within a day the battery would drop down to 95% just from turning it on.\nOverall, it is hard to explain every single detail about the Macbook Air here, but it is definitely worth it. I would recommend this is any college student, or even high school students who want a simple laptop that is super manageable and easy to use. It turns on within 10 seconds, and also shuts off very quickly. The only thing I would say is that the price is a bit high for a laptop, but sometimes there are discounts and sales. Got mine for 50$ off sale, and an additional 100$ off student discount. :)",

The Galaxy phones, on the other hand, just go and go. I love the call quality, the user interface, and the variety of applications. I would recommend this phone to anyone looking to get a new device.",

        "comment": "I own a macbook pro and an iMac (27') but decided to update my macbook pro with the new Macbook air. I was skeptical at first but decided to give this option a shot.\n\nI can tell you that this was not only the cheapest option currently available, but also it the most outstanding laptop I could have gotten. The first thin you will notice is the weight which is almost non existent (compared to the macbook pro). There after you will notice the incredible speed, once it is turned on it will change the way you ever see other computer speeds. Booting time happens in a blink of the eye, sleep to on happens before you even get to turn on he computer, and your opinion of loading times will have to be re-evaluated. Now for the battery life, the display stated 14 hours left of battery when I checked it. Even if this was incorrect and the 12 hours advertised will still blow my mind. This means I can go to school, do my work, and still have enough juice to do what I like at the end of the day.\n\nFor the complaints I have been reading regarding wireless problems, I do not know if this issue has been patched since, or if I just do not have the same problems? But I have yet to experience any such problems. Not saying its not true, but I have not yet had the agony of this wireless issue.\n\nIf you are looking for a solid piece of equipment that will last for years to come, this should be on your list as top contender! I will actually order a second one fully loaded for business use.",

I have listed to other people talk from the phone and i am very pleased with the sound and strength of the signal...It seems to work well in marginal reception areas.

When you press the \"Apps\" button, it takes you to the apps very quickly, whereas my previous phone there was definitely a lag. It has a lot of space - included in the phone and you can also use a micro SD chip. A few quibbles: When talking on the phone, the other person can sound a bit muffled, which can be a little annoying. I went to the store to have it checked out, but also did some online research. It just seems like this is how the phone is. And a very minor quibble: The home screen doesn't change orientation when you turn it horizontal, but the horiz/vert. change seems to works everywhere else it can.

If all you need is typing documents and web based things however I would suggest the $250 Chromebook by Google, as that will suit most people. I like most people needed a full computer which is what the Macbook Air is. Its a full computer. I can even play some pretty rough games on it and medium settings. Minecraft for example, runs at full settings at 60FPS. This is easily the best computer I have ever owned. I caught a back to school sale plus a student discount and ended up paying $200 less overall which was a lifesaver.",

Apple experience has always been a step above the rest, but it has failed to provide any game changing experience to it's product in the past few years. Maybe we're all too spoiled and expect the world from Apple since the birth of the Ipod.",

Mac OS is great, however, I notice that it does take time to log into some websites and some websites appear to be made only for IE.

Switching from an Apple to a Droid creates a rather steep learning curve, but with patience it can be done.\nI love the camera and it's features, along with the large screen.\nThe fact that this phone is so customizable is wonderful. You can make it do pretty much whatever you want, as well as create your own visual setup.\nWith help I downloaded a new Yahoo keyboard that really makes it much easier and faster to use.\nMy major complaint is the battery life. Regardless of everything I've tried, the battery doesn't last nearly as my iPhone.\nAfter a few months of use I think I'll likely be a convert to windows phones.",

        "comment": "I owned a Gateway NV series laptop for the last five years, it was hot, slow, and not dependable. That's why I got the Macbook Air. I'm glad I didn't get the 11 inch screen because that would've been too small. For the extra $100 it's well worth the upgrade to the 13 from the 11. It also has a bigger battery and a couple of more hours of battery life.\n\nIt boots up in seconds, it's ultra portable, and feels really premium. The mouse on board is second to none.\n\nIt however lacks HDMI and VGA ports. The screen is disappointingly dim without it being plugged in. I'm used to looking at my Nexus 4 all day and looking at this with the brightness turned all the way up is a bit too dim for my liking. I didn't get to play with it in the Anaheim store that I bought it at. Ended up picking it up at another store.\n\nOverall, I hope to get ten good years' use out of it. I figure I could've bought an ASUS with similar specs for half the price, but I know that Apples last a bit longer than most PCs. The biggest draw was the SSD so that my lap wouldn't burn up like it did with my old PC.\n\nIf you don't mind it being a bit dim and you don't mind spending extras to get accessories, and portability is a must this is the device for you.",

Although the price is steep for my liking, but I have no regrets spending $1,200 on this computer. It is super light and super fast. It has no lag, It's very easy to use and easy to set up with email and personal settings. Great battery life, bright screen and love the backlit keyboard.

No need for the mouse you can't live without on a PC Laptop. All the little tricks within the system are great. It works wonderfully with our iPads and IPhone. We don't experience any wifii drops. I could not be happier with its performance and features. I have been a pc user for the past 13 years due to work, software, and business issues. But finally after two laptops crapping out in the last year short of the 5 year mark and Windows, all system performance degrading that happens with Windows over time, we decided to splurge. I know the proof comes over\ntime but the initial impression compared to my dell after a month is night and day. Sure the Air does not have much storage or a DVD burner but that is what the cloud, home network storage, and peripheral add ons are for. We have another computer that has a burner. We have a MyBook Live so the storage is defiantly not a negative especially compared to the Airs weight.",

Was originally looking for Windows based notebook since most of his work is in MS program products. Apple offered good deal on MS package software and a server based service that will meet his needs in the future. Plus the apps available gave my son more options than other machines. The speed and reliability were big features plus the 11 hour battery life was super important in the school environment. I never was an Apple fan, but now with all the server based programs available Apple may have the most flexibility and performance for what we use computers for. Also it's nice for his other IOs devices to be fully compatible - I guess next he will be buying his own I-phone and I-Pad just to have the suite!",

I bought a touch screen HP for Windows 8 and upgraded. I wish I could trade that computer and get an iMac now cause it already is much slower and stuff goes wrong all the time on it.\n\nThe Mac Book Air is awesome. The battery lasts forever, I charge it like once a week. Love the guestures. It doesn't slow down. The harddrive is solid state so should never crash, and all my apple products communicate nicely now. Highly recommend. It isn't cheap, but for the amount of time I use a computer, it is worth spending the extra money, you won't regret it. Took me 2-3 weeks to get comfortable with all the Mac stuff. It is different, but much better than Windows or Chrome.",

Screen res is great and the size of the display is nice and bright. The voice commands work great without any problems. Nice and slim case but a bit slippery so must be carful not to drop. The buttons are to easy to press and cause the phone to lock/unlock when I do not want that. Volume button is right where you hold the phone so I am always changing the volume by accident. Battery life is average but not bad, would like to have more. Sound quality is very good as is the screen. Just wish it had the Gorilla Glass but I put on a high quality protector and that should do.\nOverall this has been a good choice, time will tell if it remains so",

The battery life literally lasts me for about a day and a half for pure schoolwork usage. If i use it for streaming videos or music then the battery lasts pretty much the whole day for me.

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I was always an anti-Mac a few years ago. I always sided with Windows because of the price many companies offered for laptops. There were times where the prices of laptop were less than a premium Macbook and it even offered more internally than the Macbook.\nWhen it comes to computers/laptops, I always look at the specs first and then the quality next. Windows laptops always had the better specs than Macbooks back in a few years ago. Price also was a factor too as Macbooks are still in my opinion a little too much. I know it is business and Apple is still trying to get as much until the people drift away from Macbooks (people are not going to drift away. the Macbooks are just too good).\nNevertheless it might seem the 4GB on this laptop is too small for your tastes, trust me, 4GB is more than enough. The work I've been doing on this laptop is just surfing the web with always 9+ tabs, taking notes with \"Evernote\", viewing powerpoints, writing paper, etc. I haven't played any games such as LoL or CS:GO, but from videos I've seen this Macbook Air can work like a powerhorse if need be.\nThe keyboard is simply amazing, I never though I would actually not miss my numeric keyboard. It is simply an awesome experience to use the keyboard.\nThe trackpad is my favorite part of the Macbook Air. With a large trackpad and the gestures Apple integrated into the Macbook Air, you can do tasks so quickly and efficiently. Switch desktops? Four finger swipe left or right. View your mission control? Four finger swipe up. I am able to do my online Chemistry homework without any problems at all.\nThe speakers on this Air is remarkable. I don't know how Apple does it but they do it well. Sound quality is above average and the volume can go pretty high.\nScreen size is just perfect for me. I was using a 15.6\" HP Envy and although I do see a difference in screen size, the 1440x900 makes up for it. Watching American TV shows or Korean variety shows is awesome.\nBattery performance is just amazing. I am absolutely thankful to purchase the Macbook Air with the Haswell processor. 12 hours. Yes, 12 hours on a single charge. That's if you have your brightness at like 5-6 ticks. Surfing the web is 12 hours. I once saw the battery remaining at 19 hours while I was viewing a pdf. Simply amazing. One thing that I recommend is to quit applications you don't need so you can maximize your battery life.\nPortability is simply amazing. 2.96 lbs. Wow. I'm a college freshmen now and I can tell you that carrying a 4.5+ lbs laptop is heavy already. Add some books and you will experience the worst time of your life. At the college I'm currently attending, the heat and humidity makes your life carrying that laptop inside your backpack just awful. Sweat is on your straps and the back of backpack is just not good.\nThere have been creaks here and there when I pick up the Air and such. However, I would go ahead and buy a pentalobe screwdriver for Macbook Air and tighten it yourself. The Apple Genius Associate can only do so much to help you. They might help you tighten it a bit more and they might not because it would be useless since it's an exterior manufacturing defect or some sort.\nThere are times where I would surf on the web and the page would lag for a bit and then fully load. Although it is kind of an annoyance, it is still manageable.\nThis laptop is amazing. Just amazing. For all of you college students or about to be college students I would definitely recommend this laptop. Even if you've used Windows all of your life (I have), take that leap of faith and go to the \"dark side.\" \"Once you go Mac you will never go back.\" I purchased this laptop at an incredible price, around $200 lower than the retail price. If you can manage to grab a piece of machinery at this price then definitely go for it.\nThanks!",

And the leap wasn't in adjusting to a different OS, which was easy and, yes, as Mac aficionados like to say, intuitive. It was a leap from the poor build of a PC and the perpetual hiccups of Windows 8 to the smart and solid design of my Macbook Air and the sensible and smooth-as-butter performance of Mountain Lion. Unlike Windows 8, all the features of Mountain Lion that I've encountered so far actually make sense and help with my productivity. (I use this device for my consulting biz). Everything actually works just as it's supposed to; imagine that. Couldn't be happier.",

        "comment": "This really is a great laptop on most metrics, but let's start with the one significant problem - the wifi card (which is a new 802.11ac compatible card) will repeatedly drop you on a lot of network configurations. Unfortunately, I saw this problem repeated across three replacement laptops, various router hardware and configurations, and even after the update issued by Apple that was supposed to fix this problem. It's only irritating for browsing, but it's fatal for video-conferencing. I'm hopeful it will be fixed at some point, but in the interim the less-than-ideal solution is a USB wifi receiver. It seems unlike Apple to miss on something like this, and it's a pity - it mars an otherwise excellent laptop, and it's one of those recurring things which stops you enjoying a new purchase.\n\nAnd an excellent laptop it is, otherwise. Thin, light, portable. Enough processing power for 95% of users (if you have a niche need - video editing, gaming, etc., - you may want something with a bit more grunt). No retina display on this one, which is a pity bit not a dealbreaker. But that wifi issue...",

With that being said, I'm extremely pleased with this phone, how it operates and how it handles!.\n\nThe inboard memory is adequate for what it is: A phone! Being an audiophile, I would have liked more storage space, but this phone offers a MicroSD slot that will accept up to a 64Gb chip. That is fantastic storage size!\n\nThe camera on this phone is amazing. I use it primarily to document my job (problems/completions) and have used it under houses in low light, after dark outside as well as in bright conditions and all of the pictures are crystal clear!\n\nThe sound quality is superb, but it has a tendency to keep dropping my bluetooth devices mid-call. They find each other eventually and re-connect, but it's still a pain! In point of fact, I can't be sure that the phone is the culprit alone, and not a problem with the bluetooth devices!\n\nMy previous personal device was a Motorola RAZR and was so frustrated with the short battery life with that phone, that I was almost SHOCKED when my new phone lasts ALL DAY with heavy use!. Pictures, texts, navigation, music, web browsing and calls and there's still battery life left when I get home at night!\n\nAll in all, I'm very pleased with the quality and abilities of this device!",

It has a smallish 128GB SSD hard drive which is fast as all get up and go! Instead of the pricey upgrade to a larger SSD, We chose to purchase a 2 TB TimeCapsule. This operates almost like a private cloud when set up right and is a super fast router that is flawless with the new 4th generation Intel processor chips(Haswell). Couldn't be happier! Our friends have MacBooks that are 2,4 and 6 Years old respectively, and they are still almost as fast as when they came out of the box.......Every windows based pc and laptop that we've owned slows considerably after the first year.........We look forward to many years of super fast use from our new Mac. A huge bonus is the parallels and VMWare programs that allow you to run windows in the background.....very impressed!!",

I had always used a PC and I was not ready to switch everything over. I use this for home but use it a lot for my business. After getting an iPad and my 2nd iPhone, I decided that I could do it and it would be nice to have everything sync together. I have never been happier with a computer purchase! This skinny thing is amazing! The battery DOES last a long time. I charge it up at night, take it to work, and still have enough battery life remaining at night to use it without an issue. Unreal that something with this power can have such amazing battery life.\n\nThe switch to Mac was not perfect. There are some definite differences. After a week, however, I feel like I have something down. I love the way this system works and I would never go back to a PC again. Yes, it is pricier, but I know this computer will last. If you have been on the fence, do it! You won't regret it.",

It doesn't fit well in small pockets but I can put it in a back pocket and it'll stay there.\nRecently, it suddenly 'deleted' the permanent \"contacts\" icon from my home screen. However, rebooting the phone fixed it.\nI've had this phone for about a month now and I'm quite happy with it. I gave it 4 stars only because I haven't had it all that long.

I purchased the book, OSX Mountain Lion to help me get started and to become more efficient with my Mac and the various programs. It does a great job explaining the basics and breaking down information that could be potentially complex. So far, it is a winner!!",

        "comment": "Have been looking for a ultralight laptop for a while. I was almost going to get the windows ones but Mac Air just beats everything in terms of lightweightness. I'm so glad I went with this as oppose to a windows machine. I have long days at school, and with my heavy medical books in the backpack, I save a lot of weight by carrying this laptop, which is great for my back. Also great for long days b/c you don't need to carry the charger with you all day long. The battery life just awed me. I love it and only thing I wish for was a built-in optical drive but I knew what I was getting when choosing between this and the macbook pro. Hopefully in a few years they are going to make the retina model even lighter so I can get the best of both world.\n\nOne bad thing about it is the screen gets dirty pretty easily from oil on the keyboard getting imprinted on it, also the screen attracts a lot of dust. I bought an iVisor (something that sounds like that) on amazon for $40. A bit much for a screen protector but it's the best screen protector i've ever put on by myself. no bubbles and its thick enough to make me feel like my new machine is well protected.",

The computer has froze on more than one occasion but of course ymmv. It's probably caused by a third-party application.\n\nA couple notes:\n- The SSD is VERY fast. Boot-up times are about 10 seconds on average. I only wish I had gotten more disk space as I now have to rely on external storage.\n- Dota 2 runs well (with no problem on medium settings, but will get hot on high settings\n- Guild Wars 2 runs decently at about 30fps for medium settings, but I couldn't really turn up the settings any more without noticeable lag.\n- Keyboard is excellent to type on.\n- The MBA is incredibly light.\n- Converting from windows to mac only took a couple weeks to get used to. The placement of the fn, control, alt, and command keys take time to adjust to.\n- The trackpad is hundreds of times better than any trackpad I've ever used.\n- I wish there were more ports.\n\nOverall, it's a nice buy if it's in your budget and fits your needs.",

I also got very tired of the bloatware that comes on most other computers these days. I have become a huge fan of Apple over the past few years and have purchased a number of their products. Everything \"just works\". Highly recommended for anyone who is in the market for a portable computer.",

I love the screen size because it makes it easy to use the internet and Facebook. I don't like the screen size when it comes to using it as a phone! The phone is too large to really make calls one-handed, especially if you haven't set up the one-touch calling for primary numbers.

Touch Pad gestures took about a day to get used to. Now, after less than a week, when I use my work PC, I'm frustrated that it doesn't recognize them. The computer starts up incredibly fast, and having all of my documents automatically appear on the computer from the cloud is incredible. This is the way computers should work. And although it is 3x the price of cheap notebooks, when I compared the speed, lightweight, power of this to a comparable PC, the price difference was probably about $200. And more than worth it.",

We have had it since mid August 2013.\n\nWe watched several movies on it throughout the day while she was recently in the hospital, not to mention quite a bit of internet time as well &amp; I must say the battery life is AMAZING!!\n\nI decided to go with the larger screen &amp; the smaller flash storage &amp; so far that has not been an issue at all. I am a firm believer that you should keep photos, videos, &amp; music on an external hard drive no matter what just because they eat up a lot of storage.\n\nSure you can purchase a windows laptop for a lot less, but the quality of the computer, the battery life, &amp; the overall life expectancy of the machine won't come close to touching that of a Mac.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend the Macbook Air to anyone!! I like hers so much I will be purchasing another for me in the near future!!",

However, I'm still getting used to the comparable key combinations to replace those you would find on a Windows laptop. Other than that, I absolutely love my Macbook Air and I don't know why it took me so long to switch over. My work requires me to use Windows, so I'll always have a Windows computer in my home, but, for pleasure I'm sticking with the Macbook Air. I really love it!",

        "comment": "Was torn between replacing my 7 yo MacBook and my 1st Gen iPad. Since a new iPad seems to be imminent, decided to replace the MacBook. Didn't want to spend the money for a Pro (wasn't sure whether I really needed a Pro either), but was concerned about the Air maybe not being powerful enough in comparison, but BB had a great price so decided to give it a try. Transferring data was easy but does require buying a cable.\n\nIt's definitely powerful enough, does everything you'd expect from a Mac, but it's incredibly lightweight. I mean incredibly lightweight. Just slip it in the sleeve and into my tote and off I go. You can use one hand to hold it. I worried about taking it places without the brick of a charger, but the battery life is really good. It actually feels like the charger weighs more than the Air. In fact, haven't used the old iPad since I got this and may hold off getting the iPad replacement. Lightweight does not mean really light or flimsy build. It still has a little heft. and does weigh more than an iPad, particularly the new ones.\n\nI got the 13\" instead of the 11\" because I do photo stuff. However, if I'd gotten the 11\", might think about not replacing the iPad for really quite some time. However, if you do a lot of photoshop, video/audio editing and need an ethernet connection, you probably would want something like the Pro with Retina.\n\nI don't miss the the DVD drive as I have an iMac and dropbox/iCloud. The SDHC slot is great to use. The touchpad, something I'm getting used to, is very responsive and natural. I wish it had an ethernet connection, but the wifi is working fine.\n\nPeople at meetings see it and want to pick it up and play with it. Can't believe that it's that thin and light and still does everything a laptop does.\n\nVery pleased with the decision.",

It is excellent to work with, easy to manage, easy to understand. I am new at computers and this product is amazing. Everyone always told me I should get a Mac... I am so glad I did. I started using my husbands Macbook Pro for teaching related Power Points, I soon got so accustomed to the product that I did not want to go back to any of my previous computers. I told him, \"I want my own!\" I bought a Mac Air because it is so light and convenient. I project movies on my wall from my Mac and the quality is crystal clear. I will never look back. I since have gotten an I phone and I love that as well. Now I say, \"I'm a Mac Girl!!!\"",

If I have it set to vibrate when I get a call, this sometimes gets messed up. Also, the Contacts List takes a few extra clicks to do simple things.\nOverall, I really like it!!",

I didn't feel the differences were worth the extra $200 to upgrade. Many places have this phone free with 2 year extension. Battery life is much better than my old phone. I've actually gone multiple days without charging. I do have battery saver settings turned on. Overall I'm very impressed with the phone, which got excellent reviews when it was first released. It has taken me a bit to get used to the texting keyboard, which is slightly different from HTC. Also, can't seem to figure out how to get auto correct to work. HTC was preset to this. Daughter can't figure out how to get feature turned on in S4 either. That's my only complaint.",

Maybe my specific notebook just has a glitch but that's what I've learned that I have to do or else it makes me restart it just to turn it on.",

        "comment": "I replaced an older Android product with the Galaxy SIII.\nThere are other smart phone options like the S4 and Note which I have used and technically supported, yet the S III still holds up well with the newer phone competition. It has great features such as perfect pocket size, great resolution, and tons of compatible apps. It quickly bonded and automatically connects to my 2013 Toyota Highlander for phone and media player via bluetooth. The battery life is acceptable for this type of phone but lasts much longer if you turn off push notifications, wifi, and bluetooth when not needed. Photo quality is awesome. There is no need to take a camera to a birthday party when you have this phone in your pocket. Voice recognition is awesome as it quickly responds to commands like \"navigate to Dulles airport\", \"message john call me\" for hands free navigation and texting.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I just returned my day one edition Xbox One, I had a loud grinding noise coming from it after about 4 hours of playing, I am not alone with this problem. I am also not a fan of the windows 8 style home page I much prefer the 360. The system itself runs very slow due to a super slow 5400rpm hard drive (that your stuck with) and cheap ram. While I was originally on board with the all in one idea after using it for a day I can honestly say I was not impressed at all and want no part of it. Installing games takes forever and uses way too much HD space, the Kinect voice commands are a mix bag as they work sometimes but usually don't. I am also not going to be shouting voice commands at 1:00AM when everyone is sleeping. Graphics are not bad but not that huge leap forward most people are expecting, yes they will get a bit better in the next couple years when the devs iron out the kinks but they will never match a good PC. The new controller is actually a step backwards.. It was a good idea to get rid of the battery section but the cheaper buttons on top and overall smaller size is disappointing. In the end good idea poor execution and faulty cheap parts. I honestly think that gaming consoles are finished.. They are trying to become PC's but are just too far behind still. Your better off taking the $500 and building a nice gaming PC which can be upgraded whenever you want rather than waiting another 8 years.",

After much research, about a year's worth, I finally decided to move on from the Motorola family and found that Samsung would be the most ideal choice.\n\nI've had the phone a month now and I can not believe how much easier my life has become. I don't have to wait forever for an app to open, I don't have to wait for my text writing to catch up to what I input. All the stress I had with my last phone has disappeared. I couldn't be happier with my phone! I'm now sold on Samsung quality for my phone and tablet needs!\n\nThere are only two real issues I have with this phone so far, but they are minor compared to the other issues I have dealt with on Motorola phones. The speech to text function could use some work. It seems to choose the wrong words when I speak. But, if I find one word messed up I don't have to delete the whole phrase like I had to with Motorola. The other thing is, my phone has difficulty learning my son's name.\n\nI've only had this phone a month, and am still running it through the courses. So far, I've never been happier with any phone in my life than I am with this one. It will take a lot for me to switch from Samsung in the future.",

This was only to find that the Xbox One does not support searching or playing local DLNA servers. If you have a Plex or twonky server with your movies stored locally the Xbone will not find or play them. Microsoft claims DLNA support but don't be fooled it is Play to ONLY and that doesn't work very well (I own a surface pro 2 and have tried.) or at all. I am also experiencing intermittent lockups",

So far ive downloaded the skype, machinima, and netflix apps. The one app/game that surprised me was xbox fitness. It has free workout programs such as p90x and insanity. The kinect is utilized with xbox fitness as it tracks your form and your heart rate. I find that technology completely amazing as it suggests that the kinect is technologically advanced enough to detect your heart rate. Im enjoying the ease of voice commands because its faster than using the control or hand gestures. I espcially love thw \"xbox record that\" voice command because it will record your game play which then u can edit and upload for your friends to see. The kinect also acts like a qr reader. The xbox came with a 2 week gold trial card which I simply had to scan it on the kinect and it awarded me the trial. Thats a life saver as it eliminated inputting 16 digit codes. Last but not least I love the UI... especially my friends list. It has a feed which shows what my my friends are doing or playing or achievements they made similar to facebook news feed. When all is said and done im completely happy with my purchase and with so many other things you can do with xbox I still have other things I have yet to try. I wil defenitly try the smartglass feature where the xbox communicates with any tablet or smartphone and the tv hdmi in pass through feature. Im really happy with my decision to purchase this system as it has a lot to offer.",

        "comment": "This is a good system however there are some short comings that need to be addressed. For starters to be able to tie your live TV signal into the Xbox one it has to have an HDMI port, otherwise it doesn't work. If you do decide to run your cable/sat signal through the Xbox one you can not watch TV without turning on the Xbox one, also if you do decide to run your cable/sat signal through the xbox one you can not connect the xbox one to a home theatre receiver via hdmi hook ups. There is an optical audio port on the xbox for use with a home theatre receiver however if you have a 7.1/7.2 receiver you can only run at 5.1 using the optical audio port.\nThe controller feels cheap, the xbox 360 controllers feel much better in your hand, that being said it does function very well and is very responsive. The interface can be very frustrating at times consider it is little to nothing like the OS from the xbox 360, some of the basic menus and features are not present or are buried so far inside menu after menu that you may never find them.\nOn the overall this is a great system for playing video games, however the other features being advertised by Microsoft at least at launch have been greatly exaggerated.",

First to receive at my local store, Unboxed and hooked up downloading the Day One update at 1215. Zero issues all weekend on Forza5 and COD Ghosts. BF4 is alot of fun, but the online servers have had issues booting people. Kinect works great, As long as its configured correctly during setup process. Using the kinect does give you the best overall experience, I could care less if uncle sam was watching me...he would be BORED.\n\nPre-Bundled items are great, the headset connector (to the controller) seems tight and sometimes difficult to separate as im afraid ill pull the wires and fray them So i decideded to keep it connected. Aftermarket Headsets will reduce this issue in the future.\n\nI understand there were some Xboxes being loud, running hot, etc, Sorry, mine is super quiet and has been on all weekend minus around 8hours of sleep since Friday morn.",

Has many great features, love the fitness app, tracks your movements to see how well you are doing. Have problems with the TV connection after a download, I have a scientific atlantic cable box and I saw others had problems getting it to work also, but was mixed on it when it was working. You can not watch TV with out turning on xbox which I do not like. But the voice command with volume and channels was nice, especially if you are like me and are constantly losing the remote. All in all I love this system,",

        "comment": "I have owned every major console since the original Nintendo was released. The Xbox One is the best all around console I have ever experienced. Skype is amazing, we have two children and my in laws live a few hours away. Skype on the Xbox One is terrific, the camera zooms in and pans to who is talking or where the important movement in the picture is occurring. If I was looking for a video conference system that feature alone would be worth my purchase. I have an Xbox Music account, so all of my music is there automatically. I have SkyDrive so all of my pictures and video are available as well. Vudu, Netflix, Amazon Prime are downloadable apps which deliver unlimited entertainment. I can snap any app and for instance; my wife can watch TV while I play video games. We can browse the web while watching TV. Samsung and many others have tried to do this and the delivery is so so at best. The Xbox One shines as a hub of your living room. The fact that it plays video games is almost secondary yet is in my opinion the best all around console out there. I am very happy with my purchase and I know that the Xbox One will be in my living room for many years to come.",

When we are not playing Ryse or Dead Rising 3 we are watching movies or listening to music. They really did a remarkable job with the new Kinect. The first Kinect was cool, but just a little too limited. With this new Kinect I can navigate the system and give commands while I am doing other things (like typing this review!). The Xbox One has all the apps I care about with more coming out all the time, but that main reason I bought it was because of all the amazing next gen games. And we haven't even seen what this thing can do once the game developers really start to push it!",

I purchased the X1 for its highlighted entertainment and because I want to play Forza 5. Since I returned home at 1240am I've been busy.\n\nHardware setup: crazy EASY! The directions to plug everything in was clear and simple. The cords and plugs feel sturdy and connected firmly.\n\n1st Power up and setup: out of the box there is a little delay with no real indication that anything is happening. It was just long enough for me to get antsy so, turn it on and turn away (nothing spectacular to miss). As with all media there was a 500mb update and back to the start up. Only took about 8 minutes (high-speed internet.\n\nNext - the Xbox then takes you through the basic setup. Very smooth and easy again.\n\nI tinkered around with the apps and downloaded Netflix and NFL...like I said, 40+ YO, we have priorities.\n\nTV - This was a feature I was skeptical about from the beginning so here it goes... WOW! I plugged my Xfinity Motorola cable box into the HDMI in port and in the apps section I located the Watch TV app and it started the setup automatically by identifying an input. In the next few steps the magic started happening when the Xbox learned how to talk to my cable box... my TV remote won't even do that. Next, the Xbox leaned how to talk to my Samsung Smart TV, this is when i was truly sold. I said \"Xbox Watch Discovery Channel\" the channel changed to Discovery. So I tested out the TV, \"Xbox Volume Down\" it lowered my TV volume by 2.\n\nI also located in the settings where you can sync the TV to shut off with the Xbox or Turn on with the voice command (haven't made that work yet).\n\nFinally, I also added a Bose CineMate GS Series II system and now the Xbox has learned that and controls that volume as well.\n\nIt is now 3:15am and I have not done the one thing the Xbox is so good at, played a game. i will follow up after a few hours of sleep but, I am VERY pleased with my X1 so far.",

For a long time I told my friends that they should consider samsung products and in fact I have 2 samsung TV's, 2 Samsung DVD Players, my wife has a galaxy tab 3 phone and my kids have galaxy tab tablets. I have a IPAD from my work and a HP computer and printer, much to my suprise Samsung decided to block the ability to print from their devices to anything but a Samsung printer. I thought this must just be a software update issue but when I called samsung they confirmed it. This is very short sighted and has lost me as a customer and anyone who ever thinks they might want to use a non samsung device forever. As an FYI, Apple, Microsoft and all other android devices can print to the printer and I would recommend these options to you instead of Samsung",

Not that it's a major issue, just kind of annoying on something that cost $500.",

I love having the hdmi pass through which allows me to connect my Directv receiver and easily switch between games and tv with a simple command. The snap feature allowing you to do two things at once is awesome, and there are lots of apps from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, etc built in. So far, all these features are working great and the only hitch is with the accuracy of the Kinect voice commands. I find it much easier to use the remote or Smartglass app on my smartphone.",

Only thing you may wanna pick up is a Xbox Live card for online play. I picked up 3 games to go with the system and the graphics have really impressed. The games require you install the first time you put in the disc. The controller feels great in my hand and is very responsive. I haven't had any issues with the system after playing for about a week. Its really cool being able to tell the Xbox what to do like turn it on or off. The only minor complaint I have is the limited games at launch. I have really enjoyed my purchase and would recomrecommend anyone getting one if you can find it.",

The 13 inch is just over 2 pounds I believe, and is no less portable than the 11 inch. The 13 inch is better for watching movies and using games, plus it gets a better battery life. I watched a 2.5 hour movie on medium brightness and it was still at above 70% when the movie ended! I also played batman arkham asylum and it ran fine on medium settings, and windows 8 through bootcamp I played skyrim on medium. Skyrim was perfect as well, I wss amazed. Not great on the battery but that is expected as it is no gaming computer. Great in every way, and no matter which macbook you get whether the air or new retina, get the at least the 13 inch (air offers 11)!!",

        "comment": "From the moment you turn on the XB1 you know you're in for a treat for years to come. My first game played was Ryse Son of Rome. Ryse's graphics is what you should expect from next gen consoles and more. Everything from battles to forests and the smallest details on the characters armor.\n\nI have my Comcast box running through it. It works just like you saw in the pre release demos. Seamless switching from TV to games to apps. I love it!! My complaints would be the price and the lack of strong launch titles. Both complaints will be solved in time.\n\nAssassins Creed 4, Dead Rising 3 and Battlefield 4 are incredible! I would suggest buying any one of those as your first Xbox One game! I gushed on Ryse only because it showed me what XBox One is capable of in terms of graphics.",

        "comment": "Got the system the day of release and have been impressed with the voice commands (both in the games and in the xbox menu.) Although I find myself repeating myself at times at the Kinect I feel it's only a matter of time they do updates to clear up those issues. I purchased Ryse:Son of Rome as my first game and the graphics are great and gives you an idea of how great the graphics will be for future games. The voice commands for the xbox menu and tv are great. I only wish that I didn't have to kind of yell in order for it to hear my commands but it's not so bad. Overall, I would say that the XBoxOne is pretty good so far. It's still too early to figure out which system is better between the PS4 (I plan on having both anyway) but I'm really looking forward to Titanfall and other games that will be able to utilize the power of the system.",

The launch line up us pretty decent, with titles like Dead Rising 3 and Forza 5 standing out above others. The interface is very smooth and easy to use, and voice navigation with the new kinect is a much better experience than on the Xbox 360. There are a few bugs with the kinect, and with time Microsoft will improve its accuracy. Give this thing a few more months and it will be a nearly perfect system.",

I have battlefield for PC and it looks way better on the PC then on the xbox but the multiplayer is faster in level loads and wait times on the xbox. I enjoy having a console already ready to go on the TV then having to take the time to connect my PC and dealing with the keyboard and mouse when things don't go perfectly. So it was either the ps4 or xbox and I couldn't get hands on a ps4 so I was able to get the xbox and try it out. And so far I like it. I game on the PC most of the time but having a console is never a bad choice either. Just deciding to wait for games on the PC is the hard thing but they are getting better at timely releases lately since more and more people are acknowledging how awesome the PC is..",

Voice commands are simple but make sure you set up the kinect according to how it instructs you to on screen. Kinect is excellent and recognizes everything. The skype feature is cool as well, love how the kinect follows you around. Only thing I can complain about is how you can not input an external USB drive for other media like the 360.",

The Xbox is definetly a great buy if your looking for more than just a gaming console. System has been working with no problems, but just like all firsts expect some issues down the road. Xbox vs ps4, I'd say get both.. if you cant afford it? Your good with either one",

Only negatives are the longish install times for games. I think this has to do with software updates being done at the same time. Also you have to download apps for simple functions like the Bluray player. Thankfully they are free and fast to install, just another step not to forget during the setup.",

The launch games are what I expected in terms of quality, and I'm looking forward to developers pushing the capabilities of the system.\n\nI love the TV/media integration. The interface is good enough to eliminate the need for a roku/apple tv. No need for another HDMI port, and gives more control without having to switch inputs.\n\nI haven't gotten too deeply into the smartglass application, but what I've seen of it has potential.\n\nThe controller is slightly improved from the 360, but not too much. Still my favorite controller, so why change a good thing.\n\nOverall, Microsoft has a solid offering with their new console. Time will tell how others feel, but my impressions have been positive and I'm extremely happy with it so far.",

The games look fantastic on the system and while the system is a bit big it is a very attractive looking piece of equipment which will look great on anyone's entertainment shelf. So far I'm very happy with the look, performance, and controls of this system. However, as mentioned in the front caption of this review, I am very disappointed that it did not have 3D bluray movie support and I had no choice but to keep my 3D bluray player. So Microsoft, just go on and add it already and make it a truly \" all in one \" system.",

They need more titles like now and the controller is a littler smaller which can cramp you hands after intense play on Killer Instinct or a heavy battle. Overall it is great, just needs to cater to the majority of players in the middle age bracket that have bigger than 10 year old hands and empty nest syndrome from the accessories they had on the 360.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "So far I love the Xbox One. I have my tv running through the system to try out the voice control. The voice control is fun, you can tell the Xbox to start up a game, switch to an app like Netflix, switch to television, check your Xbox messages, etc. You can set up the voice control to control your Cable/Satellite box and your TV, it can change channels for you, example say Watch ESPN, it will change to ESPN for you, you can adjust tv volume among other things.\n\nI purchased Dead Rising 3 and Call of Duty: Ghost. I am hooked on Dead Rising, COD is still sealed up but I am excited to get to it in the near future. I think the system could still use some tweaking, the voice control only works about 60% of the time, it seems if there is any background noise at all the kinect has a hard time hearing you without shouting and I feel like an idiot shouting at my tv! I am hoping there is a way to improve this experience or at the very least add a microphone functionality to the controller much like some of the smart TV's.\n\nOn a side note the right control stick on my bundled controller seems to be broken after a weeks worth of use, for some reason the up and down directions to not work at all, left and right are fine. Luckily I purchased a second controller, so far that one is ok, will be looking into getting the other controller replaced.\n\nAll and all I'm enjoying the system for the multimedia capabilities and the gaming capabilities. I'm not an Xbox fan boy by any means, this is the first time I've purchased a Microsoft system ahead of a Sony system but I couldn't resist the voice control and frankly most of my friends plan to purchase an Xbox One in the near future. I'm not super impressed with the list of launch titles, hoping to see a Gears of War or Halo sometime in the nearish future!",

The first time you answer a skype call and then jump straight back into gaming, or watching TV/Netflix, you will realize why Microsoft was right to push for making more than just a game console. Only gear enthusiasts will find compelling reasons to be early adopters, but this system will be in every serious gamer's arsenal in the very near future. A year from now, the dashboard and user experience will be almost certainly a different product when you turn the machine on. In the early days, though, the growing pains don't seem too prominent. There is a known issue with the TV app crashing that has a workaround. Just put the One in power saving mode in settings. It should be patched very soon.",

I also enjoy being able to control most functions by speaking to the system.\nI wish there were more games worth playing but this is typical of new systems at launch. The console can be a little slow at times when I'm trying to simultaneously record the last 5 minutes of gameplay, search for a new lobby, and \"Go Home\" to look at something else. My Xbox One hasn't suffered any significant problems. My controller did stop working after a few hours and I had to get a new one but it has worked flawlessly aside from that.",

I, personally, am unable to turn on the Xbox with voice commands, which is not an essential feature, but it would be nice if it worked as advertised. (I did turn on the feature in my settings). I had no interest in any of the games that were launched so I haven't tested any of those. It's an interesting machine so I will keep it until better things come our way.

Be able to watch netflix movies and amazon videos make it more enjoyable. Only fact I didn't like was the fact that the system seems to be running \"quietly\" even after I turn it off! Maybe it's my console or maybe it's for the Kinect. Then I started thinking about the Kinect being on and listen to conversation and NSA. All crazy theories aside, I care for the longevity of the system and my electric bill than just be able to turn it on with a quick voice prompt. So I unplug the system every time :o). Other than that, it's an awesome system!",

Titles developed exclusively for the One (Forza, Ryse) are much better looking than multi-gen titles like Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty.\n\nBut it doesn't feel finished. Kinect voice controls work most of the time. The times they don't work, though, are really frustrating. Kinect also misreads my feet as hands when I kick them up to watch a movie. Sometimes Kinect thinks I'm trying to pause or give some other command while watching a movie when I'm just shifting my weight around.\n\nI'm sure the Kinect features will improve with time, but they're not whiz bang space age stuff that screams \"Buy Me Now!\" At least not for the time being. Bottom line: a fun experience for early adopters but probably not worth $500 for most gamers at this point. Re-consider once the library has grown and the Kinect has more spit and polish.",

I would hit the power button and it would make the start-up sound, then shuts off. It would be powered up for probably only 2 seconds. I continued to troubleshoot the problem and check online. I plugged it into an outlet, let the power cable reset (unplugged it for over 30 minutes), unplugged the Kinect before powering it on. I even worked with Microsoft support for over 2 hours, getting handed off from one technician to another and no one knew what the problem was. I eventually had to send it through FedEx back to Microsoft for a new one. They paid for shipping but not the super specific packing instructions that cost me $35 (on top of the $500 system). It was a two day rush delivery, but now it's just sitting in their \"repair center\" in Texas....just sitting. All they have to do is swap out a new one but I have no idea what's taking so long. So much for standing in line at midnight only to get the worst fate for a Xbox supporter of 8 years. Good job, Microsoft.",

        "comment": "What I like:\n+ I always was surprised that through the entire life of the Xbox 360 (including the 360 S and 360 E), there was an unacceptable amount of lag on many core dashboard functions. Something as basic as showing your list of games, or list of gamerpics to change to, or achievement lists, or loading marketplace screens, would often take several seconds or waiting to populate. The Xbox One's startup is acceptably fast, but could still be improved on, but basic things like loading marketplace content or my list of installed apps, achievements, etc, is very quick. Switching between game and dashboard is no longer the slow annoyance it used to be, but rather is nearly instantaneous.\n\n+ Dashboard Layout: The Xbox 360 dashboard was too cluttered and poorly organized, in my opinion. There were many different 'sections' to scroll through with LB and RB that made it take longer than necessary to get around. The Xbox One dashboard only has three now, it's much cleaner and simpler. Your pinned games/apps, main section to switch back to currently in-use game/app or browse your other apps, etc, and the third section is for browsing/downloading new games/apps. Very easy to navigate. I also like the notification and achievement changes. You can earn 0-point achievements in random apps, like for watching videos and such. It's admittedly pretty pointless, but if you don't like the idea of pointless achievements, you can easily ignore their existence.\n\n+ Built-in game DVR. Very cool feature that removes the need for external recording equipment for anyone interested in that. Even if you don't plan on using this feature, it could still benefit you in the form of more &amp; better guide videos from other people that will likely be swarming onto YouTube.\n\n+ The controller. Controller design has come a long way since the old Atari joysticks or uncomfortable NES gamepads. I have used Sony's Dual Shock 3, Nintendo's Wii U Pro controller, Xbox 360 controller and Xbox One controller. They are all fantastic. But I must say I always liked the 360 controller the best. The Xbox One controller is simply an improvement upon that one. The only downside to the 360 controller was the mediocre D-pad, which has definitely experienced a massive improvement in the XBO update. They also moved the guide/dashboard button higher, which I like since I used to accidentally hit that when I meant to hit Start/Back. I even like how they redesigned the battery to go inside the controller. It takes slightly longer to swap a battery out, but since I use the USB cable to charge instead of swapping batteries (no Quick Charge Kit yet exists for the One like the 360 has), that doesn't matter at this point. The only thing I don't like is renaming the Start and Back buttons. \"Press Menu\" sounds way less cool than \"Press Start\" you're used to on any game's splash screen.\n\n+ Noise levels and cooling/reliability. Anyone who had a launch Xbox 360 or launch PlayStation 3 (I have both) knows what I'm talking about. Those things were LOUD. Distractingly loud. Even over my high-end surround speakers. The Xbox One's internal fan is very large compared to the launch 360 (google photos if its internals). Large fans can move more air and are not as loud as small fans. This also helps with its reliability, as the Xbox 360's biggest launch issues were overheating problems. Microsoft learned from this and I guarantee that will not be an issue here. I wanted to make sure of this, so I have literally had my Xbox One powered on almost 24 hours a day for the last week since launch day. This is because if it's going to overheat, I want to know now rather than down the line after the warranty is up. And I'm killing two birds with one stone because Killer Instinct has some goals related to how long you are in practice mode, so I leave it idling in practice mode while at work. Yeah, call me crazy. But anyway, so far, it has handled being constantly on for days at a time with not a single issue.\n\n+ I obviously can't speak for everyone else, but my Xbox One console, disc drive, controller, and Kinect, all function flawlessly and had absolutely no issues.\n\nWhat I'm not thrilled about:\n- Launch line-up. If you are on the fence about buying the console and you're not immediately sure what game(s) to even get for it, you could easily wait it out a while longer. Forza 5 and some of the multi-platform releases are pretty cool, but I'm not sure they're $60 cool. If you are buying the Xbox One now, you're doing it for the novelty of being among the first to have a cutting-edge system. This is true with the PS4 as well. Anybody who swears by any of the launch game is just a fanboy drone. There are a handful of *pretty good* games for both systems, but I see them as more of $30-40 titles. Honestly, I've enjoyed the downloadable Xbox One games the most, such as Killer Instinct, or the free Kinect Sports trial. Big disappointment is that digital versions of full retail games cost MSRP. Until Microsoft shares some of the cost reduction from going all-digital (no marketing, manufacturing, shipping, middle-man retailers, etc), I will ALWAYS buy my games in the form of the retail disc version. A $60 retail game should be $40-50 tops from the Xbox Live Store.\n\n- No backwards compatibility. This would have been an even more important feature now than it was on the Xbox 360. We've now had eight years to build up a game library on our Xbox 360s. Mine is quite large. Not being able to use that collection as a buffer between Xbox One launch, and when all the great XBO exclusives hit, is very disappointing. The original Xbox only had four years to amass its game library, and since it was the first of Microsoft's consoles, there were far less owners with far less games than now exists with the Xbox 360. A lot of the same sentiments apply to the PlayStation 4. Both consoles could have benefited greatly from a backwards compatibility feature, since neither of their game libraries will be very expansive for at least a year or so.\n\n- USB Ports. All three versions of the Xbox 360, including the launch version, had 2 USB ports in the front of the console. My 360 S also has 3 in the back. I like never running out of USB ports. But the Xbox One has zero USB ports in the front. So my Play and Charge cable has to plug into the side of the Xbox, meaning the cable can't reach as far, and someone tripping over the cable is more likely to result in damage to the console and/or cable. I'm also disappointed that external storage via USB isn't supported at launch, though it sounds like that is coming later on.\n\nThe bottom line is this: It's a great console with great potential, but as with most launch consoles, the games just aren't quite there to back it up, YET. If you are on the fence over the console because of the 360's launch reliability, I would honestly not let that hold you back on this one since Microsoft learned a very painful &amp; expensive lesson from that, and designed a much more reliable console this time around. If you are waiting because you're unsure of the game library, you may be justified in continuing to wait. I honestly just got it because I knew for sure I would eventually get it anyway when Halo 5 comes out. But it the price is holding you back, you may have to wait YEARS for this to become affordable. So if you are okay waiting that long, great. But otherwise you might as well get it now so you can actually use it while you wait for the game library to improve. Chances are, there won't be any price cuts on it for at least a couple years, and the price cuts aren't usually anything significant until around 4-5 years after launch. So if you have the patience (I didn't), definitely wait. But since I am 98.4% sure the price will still be $499 when Halo 5 comes out, I figured I may as well get it now along with the extra pre-order perks.\n\nA solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "Xbox one is awesome. You can connect your tv to the back as an input and then display tv side by side with your game by saying xbox watch tv. I have purchased a ps4 and an Xbox and found the Xbox to be something new. Something I needed to complete my entertainment center. It is a media hub. Ps4 has many great apps and the new interface is good, but it isn't anything close to what you get with Xbox Dashboard. Xbox live has beeen working well on all games that I bought for it. Psn is still down three weeks after launch. Now you are paying for the same garbage online service that used to be free. Since I normally am playing online, this was huge for me. The controllers are both better than the last gen and I can't say I like one more than the other. I do like that by saying Xbox off my xbox turns off my television, the Xbox, and my receiver. The ps camera doesn't even compete with new kinect. If you buy the ps4 camera to compete with the bundled kinect, you are almost at the same price. If you are deciding what console to get, you can choose the cheap less fun ps4 or something that you will use for way more than just games, and is more than any smart tv, or gaming console before could offer.\n\nThe graphics are barely better than Xbox 360. Ps4 graphics are also the same proportion to the ps3. This could have been improved. My nvidia Titan blows these out of the water. The refresh rate on Xbox makes games look very smooth in fast motion...BUY IT. Even if your child wants a ps4. Ge them this and you and them will both be happier.",

Neither a fan boy nor an electronic extremist, I truly feel the Xbox One is the console that everyone has under estimated.\n\nDespite it's public follies during its original revealling, I think M.S. did a great job to write their wrongs and taylor the console to better suite the needs of the masses.\n\nBear in mind that this review is truly unbiased, in that I also picked up a PS4 on launch date. As much as the PS4 is smaller and looks sweeter, the launch titles are slim to none. Furthermore, PS+ has been having connection issues lately. (Probably due to the flood of new account activations post-Black Friday)\n\nIn the end, I say BOTH consoles are equally matched in graphics and performance. (Comparing Battlefield 4 on both)\n\nXbox One is a good choice if you want to have other launch titles to choose from (ie. Dead Rising 3 or Forza). Plus the new kinect features are a must with this console, hense validating its $500 price point compared to the PS4. Only main drawback for now is that it's a HUGE console and it's heavy. (Maybe a concern if you have a glass entertainment center)\n\nPS4 is still equally just as good, but the slim selection of launch titles and connection issues with PS+ are all that drop this console a little lesser than the Xbox One...

        "comment": "Bought on Day One, and it has not disappointed (for the most part). When I bought the system, I also bought CoD: Ghost as well as Ryse. Let me first say that Ryse truly displays the beautiful graphics the next-gen system has to offer. Ghost is also an improvement from the 360 version. Since we bought it, my wife and I have enjoyed many hours of Netflix and it has been a breeze to use. The only aspect I dislike so far is the party function. Compared to the 360, the XBONE has really taken a step back in this area. It is a bit of a pain to use and was difficult to figure out at first. Now Microsoft has already noted that they are working on a patch to make this better, and once it updates hopefully everything will be as it should. Other than that, one amazing piece of all-in-one entertainment!",

So far I have played COD ghosts, Forza 5 LE, Dead Rising 3 and I've been extremely happy with all three. The graphics are really good and are a major improvement over the 360 which is too be expected, when I played the display at a Microsoft store it was like looking through a window and in makes my 4 year old sony lcd 46\" look like our new Samsung led 55\" we got in 2012. The controller has some nice features, no protruding battery, the IR sensors are cool, the smaller thumbsticks &amp; large triggers feel great but the LB/RB buttons feel harder to reach than before and the texture is slippery with dry hands. Kinect 2.0 works very well once you learn the commands &amp; remember to say xbox first. The old kinect was frustrating &amp; could never hear me unless I yelled, but the new kinect can hear just your everyday normal voice. I'm amazed at the features the Xbox one can do, I had know idea it could automatically turn my TV &amp; DirecTv box on &amp; off as well as control volume/mute, change channels via Kinect, play/pause recorded shows, record gameplay, and much more. And when I saw in the settings it could control TVs &amp; Sat boxes I didn't think it would work with my 4 year old tv that has no smart features and a new but basic second room Satellite box but it connected &amp; worked with both easily. I charged the rechargeable battery twice after two 6-10 hour gaming sessions but have since played at least 24 hrs without charging and the controller has showed no signs of dying anytime soon, but there is no more battery meter in the menu so you really have no clue when it will die. Xbox live appearance could be refined some more. I hope Microsoft has a remote in the works, it would come in handy when I want to watch TV at nite or just turn everything off but don't won't to use the controller and can't talk cause others are sleeping . Other people seem to be having a bunch of different issues but I haven't experienced anything major. My only problem has been that it stopped turning my TV/Sat box on and wouldn't pass through a sat signal after being on for 6 days, all I had to do was a hard reset/reboot and its been working fine since. For $500 a extra controller and a bigger hard drive would have been nice, but I'll take what's offered since we really don't have any say so. Xbox 360 was a way better console than PS3 (especially after sony started making them cheap) but this time around the hardware specs and price are making the\nPS4 the better choice, and while I don't regret purchasing the XBOX ONE I might just have to get a PS4 too so that I'll have them both.",

        "comment": "I got the console on release. I bought it with cod ghost and ryse both games play really well. The new voice commands that is used with kinect work better than I thought, also the tracking works a lot better than the first. The tv pass through, is not really pass through. The xbox needs to be on to watch tv when connected through it. But it does work well. If you have an AVR that is in use you can plug it that in to the hdmi and pass everything through it. I don't recommend that setup because of lag that might be induced. Also at this time, optical out only passes stereo and not surround sound, but that is not a big deal. It will come as an update. Another issue that will be remedied soon is that none of the existing headsets that work for the 360 will work for the one, this will be corrected with and add on after the first of the year. Again this is a solid device that will make any gamer happy.",

When I did, however, I really did feel liek I was unleashing the nex generation of not just game consoles, but whole home entertainment systems.\n\nSetup was easy and guided. The single game, Call of Duty: Ghosts, that I had purchased to play on it downlaoded quickly (digital download) and installed in a trickle. As promised, I was able to begin playing when it was approximately half-way installed so I didn't have to wait for the whole thing.\n\nContinued use has been great. I use Amazon Instant Video for streaming and that app was available immediately.\n\nThe only app that was hard to find and was pre-installed was Internet Explorer. For some reason you have to Bing it on the system (ironic) and then pin it to the home screen for quicker access int he future. Strange.\n\nIn all, it has been a great experience and I am excited to see how Microsoft continues to improve upon such a great launch product.",

I would like the system to get more Xbox only games but it's early in the console cycle. The console is much more bulky than ps4, I wish it was a little more compact. The controller feels good in your hands, Xbox has finally removed the bulky back battery. The Xbox One no longer runs loud like the xbox 360. I like the tv features like watching tv as I play games but I wish that you could control the volume of each. Overall a good system needs some patches but it's a huge step up from the xbox 360.",

Ive read reports of disc errors, firmware update problems and other things but i havent experienced any of those. And if you do, microsoft has you covered so just be patient. The voice recognition software is much better then i thought it would be right out of the box. All the commands listed work well for me. the only issue i have is if the volume is up you have to speak louder then the tv for the kinect to hear you which makes sense but if you like it loud it wont hear you. The app system is just like your phone so in time there will be an app for everything. the early apps cover you're basic needs and work well but there is room for improvement and they will over time. And thats probably the biggest issue for this system. Everything works to a point and sort of feels rushed. If microsoft had another year it might come out of the box perfect but it needed to compete with sony so it needs some updates and bugs worked out. It just a matter of time, but this is the console to have for a complete system integration. A lot of fun!",

Upon installing initial update it does seem to freeze with the xbox logo but you just have to wait 10 min. The new kinect works amazingly well. Voice commands all seem to work seemlessly except for the initial command to turn everything on. Sometimes I have to say that twice. It works well with my cable and as far as gaming the graphics speed and detail are significantly improved. It needs DLNA for those of us with existing media servers. Skydrive works but requires to much effort to switch over my existing media server and I'm not sure how much storage skydrive offers for free. DLNA is much more efficient. The console makes no noise from what I can tell. And works well to integrate my whole living room entertainment into one piece with the exception of lack of proper DLNA. Because of that I'm hanging on to my ps3 for the time being.\nSkype was really fun to use. No matter where I moved in my living room the camera followed me and always made me center stage.\nAll in all I'm very happy with the Xbox One. Just hope they will add proper DLNA.",

I couldn't find anything I was happy with and this was actually cheaper than the HP option with similar options I was looking for. I had a HP Spectre for work and it claims 8 hours battery life abd after one month it was down to 3 hours hours and their support said it is a \"hardware issue they are trying to figure out\". So I went went this and I have been blown away by the ease of use and the battery life, amazing. I forum I read daily said with the new OS installed, Mavericks, this will get up to 15 hours with normal use...and I have gotten just about that and all I use it is everyday internet and email use. If you want to spend a little extra money on a laptop that will last and has great quality, this is the way to go.",

Other than that my controller makes an awful vibrating sound from the new trigger vibrator. Maybe just a faulty controller. Graphics are ridiculous though.

I couldnt be happier with my decision. Yes, any Mac product you purchase will have a little bit of a sticker shock but it is totally worth it. I use my laptop every single day and I have not had one single glitch with it. I would recommend this product to anyone who inquired about it. The light weight model is perfect when traveling. The dashboard is also a lot more welcoming than new windows home screens.",

The voice integration is great and although sometimes can give you a little trouble, it's definitely an outstanding feature. As is the kinnect motion sensor that's included. The all in one console that connects to your cable box is also incredible and a very exciting innovation. The only negative is the slight price change over the PS4 and of course the lack of backwards compatibility (which goes for both sides), but other than this, the xbox one is truly the most innovative system on the market",

It also seemed to be add problems to my viewing experience on Cable.\n\nLiked: Graphics. and Kinect, Wow what an improvement.\n\nLiked: Easy Setup better battery planning on the controller. Bing search is also really neat and I sure have enjoyed the OneGuide aid. It found my shows right away and added them to my favorite shows list. Cool. Tried Skype and that worked very very well.\n\nThe downside.... Game launch delays will slow sales on both next gen consoles . Less online friends to enjoy gaming with this.

        "comment": "If you think an xbox is just for teenagers who don't have dates on Friday night you're wrong. The xbox one bridges the gap between tv, movies, games, and web. Almost semlessly takes you to a disired destination just by voice command. For the gamer in you the next step in graphics and gaming realism, like in FIFA 14 ignite engine, show what pervious systems could only half resemble.\nMy only poor remarks would be that because of the fact that it's so new and limited console numbers released the games available are few and people online few too. Even the xbox's legendary game, debatably the game that breathed life into xbox, halo isn't even available. Not asking for halo 5 but come on, release halo4 at least! Couple that with the fact that only a lucky number get to own the system at this moment playing online can sometimes seem like you're the only one who got an xbox on release day. Hardware wise speaking the voice commands can sometimes make you feel like you're yelling at your xbox.\nAll things considered, more xbox games will come out, more xbox one's will become available for sale, so while these issues I've brought up Might seem major, a little bit of patience will return years of happiness with your new system. Welcome to the new way we look at our TV and gaming consoles.",

        "comment": "I bought a PS4 and owned it for one week. Played two games - BattleField 4 and Killzone. They were okay. PS4 was faster to setup and get going but I found it very limited in terms of what else can it do besides play games. I bought the Xbox One a week later and it's a far superior machine for my lifestyle.\n\nThe voice function of Kinect is awesome. I was hesitant at first but it gets the commands right 90% of the time. I use it to flip between watching shows on DirecTV to games back to TV. You can even tell it to change the channel or bring up the channel guide. I use this feature all the time. Xbox One plays Blu ray DVD's in perfect clarity. Also it plays audio CD's, which I found out the PS4 does not do.\n\nAs for resolution wars between PS4 and Xbox One, it's complete BS. My TV is a Panasonic 65\" ST series and has arguably the best screen resolution of any TV on the market that isn't a 4K model. While BattleField 4 and Killzone looked really good on the PS4, neither could hold a candle to Ryse Son of Rome on the Xbox One. The best two looking games of any next gen console that are out are Ryse and Forza and it's not even close.\n\nSkip the Ps4 if you use your Xbox as entertainment center to play TV and movies. The extra $100 was easily worth it.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "Well, here we have it, after long awaiting for the current gen cycle of consoles to end, the next generation of gaming has arrived. With the Xbox One, Microsoft has thrown down their iteration of the console wars.\nWas it worth the wait and the price of admission? Well yes and no.\n\nFor 499+tax\nThe console is sleek and squared as an Xbox should be. The kinect is a bit bigger than expected as I don't have a ton of room for peripherals like that. You also get the power cord and brick, HDMI cable, headset and one controller.\nThe first big positive I want to mention is the controller, it is awesome! It feels great in your hands and the buttons and sticks are easily accessible and very ergonomic in nature. They're sensitive to the right motions so you don't have to over compensate. The drawback here is that out of the box it has AA batteries. You can buy the plug and play separately.\n\nThe interface is where Microsoft shines with this sucker. For those of you familiar with the Windows 8 metro, you will likely feel right at home here with the xbox one. Getting around menus and different areas is pretty easy, pinning things to your home screen and quickly accessing them is simple. You can do all of this with the controller, but ah! They touted all the voice features before launch right? Well let me tell you that I've already been using them a lot more than expected. They as of right now are not 100% accurate. The commands you have to speak are also very specific in nature and sometimes it takes one or two tries for the xbox to recognize. I think this has more to do with my voice or how I speak at times. I have found myself yelling at the box more than once because it won't listen.\nI personally love the HDMI pass through on the back that allows you to hook up your TV cable box to it. This makes your entire entertainment experience quite streamlined. You can set it up so saying XBOX ON turns on your console, cable box, and TV all at once. You can navigate all menus and your entire TV guide with voice commands, change the channel, turn the volume up or down, add favorite channels to their own list, etc. This itself is a pretty cool feature for us TV watching couch potatoes. It is especially awesome for me to be able to change the channel while holding a newborn.\n\nThe games and their appearances are fantastic. I play a lot of Forza 5 and Battlefield 4 and they are simply stunning, even on my bottom of the bucket 32 inch TV. You will not be disappointed at how your games look, especially if you have a larger TV setup.\n\nOne of the biggest launch drawbacks was the games available. There just wasn't a whole lot of choices. And there really wasn't anything NEW. Dead Rising THREE, Forza FIVE, Battlefield FOUR. Pretty much all launch titles were sequels or sports games. No new IP's came out that you really were looking forward to. I guess there was RYSE but that didn't get reviewed all that great.\n\nI guess I could go on but to sum it up.\n\nI'm glad I bought the Xbox One. Could it have waited until there were more games out there to play? Absolutely, but I wasn't willing to try and hunt one down any closer to the holidays.",

        "comment": "Capable of multitasking while in game. Some features will log you out of game or other apps. You get the same familiar UI that Xbox has used from the 360 with vast improvements. The friends function is a little odd. Basically you add a friend, and they have to add you back instead of the request option that automatically creates a friend connection. The voice commands are a little touchy and sometimes your xbox turns off because of background noise. Overall, I'm impressed with the nextgen console and if you're a gamer you'll get accustomed to the system very fast. Probably has more features that I have yet to dive into.",

All the technical settings are gone after the initial setup so once you set the sound and voice separation. I don't like having to speak like I'm a drill sergeant every time I command the Xbox to respond. Also, communicating with friends with 360 and others on the One aren't available to hear and send voice messages.\n\nThe minimum apps are expected due to the recent release of a product, and I anticipate many more apps for it soon.\n\nBut the best things are the amount of memory available, the speed of the switch of programs and downloads, and the potential for better graphics/details to new games.",

If you are looking for slightly better graphics and new game titles, then yes it's better. If your looking for reinvention of the wheel, you will be let down. Don't get me wrong the Kinect voice commands and integration are great, but I don't know if that is enough of a reason to splurge for such an expense.\n\nOnce you open the product, the setup is a snap, very polished and user friendly. It comes will all the cables you will need to set it up.\n\nThe Cons:\nThe Xbox 360 will play DLNA content from a local media server, the Xbox One will only play local media if it is pushed from a computer (The 360 could browse media). This seems like a fatal flaw to me, but could be fixed with a software update.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "The Xbox One has a lot of potential for the future. Being able to control my cable box, and sound bar with voice controls is pretty cool. Not to mention I can do some skip forward, ff, etc with the actual xbox one controller as well. Jumping from cable to Netflix and back again is great, as well as being able to snap TV while I play games. In case a football/basketball game is boring but then suddenly gets interesting.\nI haven't fully played with all the settings and snap features but it works pretty well (double tapping the xbox button on the controller switches between what is snapped and what isn't would have been nice to know and not have to figure out).\n\nAs for games, there aren't a whole lot of the launch titles that I want to play but the future looks pretty great. The controller feels great as it is definitely improved over the 360 version. The only downside is that games require installs (regardless of being disc based or downloaded from the store) and COD ghosts took up 40 GB of the 500 GB HD. Which means that I've probably used 10% of my memory for 1 game. Microsoft does plan to support external HD and use Cloud storage to make this a non-issue, but It'd be nicer if the internal one was bigger or upgrade-able. I await Destiny and Halo 5 as these games will actually have had time to use the system before release.\n\nSome people have experienced buggy software issues but I personally haven't had any issues.\n\nIt currently doesn't support Xbox 360 games yet, Microsoft says they are working on that as well.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I bought the Xbox One knowing it has a lot of built in media control, but not expecting to use or like the voice controls. I have been very pleasantly surprised by how well they work, and how fast and useful they are.\n\nSetup\nSetup is very simple, plug in the power brick, Kinect, and plug in an HDMI cable and you are set. If you want to use the Xbox to control your cable/satellite box, plug its HDMI out into the Xbox One's HDMI in connection. After that, power it on and it will walk you through the software setup.\n\nKinect/Voice Command\nOnce you are setup (and here's a tip, make sure when it says to turn your speakers loud for the Kinect setup, turn them as loud as you can), you can start playing games or just playing with the voice controls and dashboard. Try saying \"Xbox select\" and it will show you all the voice commands you can use on that particular screen. If you just say \"Xbox\" and wait, it will bring up a list of voice commands, if you then say \"more shortcuts\" it will bring up a list of all voice commands. It may feel weird at first, but it is handy and fast to use the voice commands once you get used to them. It is also very \"I'm living in the future, now\".\n\nDashboard\nThe dashboard should look familiar to anyone coming from the 360 or Windows 8. Lots of tiles. You can pin your favorites, and they will be in the left pane of the dashboard. The home section will contain your last 5 apps used, whatever is in the disk drive, and your profile and friends list. If you look at your profile, you will see a feed of all your friends' activities including any 360 friends you have. There is also an achievement section for all of your achievements, though this is not very well organized to look through. In the right pane is the store. You can buy games, movies, TV shows, and music from there and they will download right to the drive for you.\n\nA few minor annoyances, I am unaware of how to view your download queue, and I am unaware of how you can manage your space on the included 500 GB drive. I know you can delete games if you like and re-download them when you want, but I haven't seen a way to view how much free space you have.\n\nApps\nThere are quite a few apps available right away. I've installed the usuals like Netflix, YouTube, Xbox video, the Blu-ray player, and many others to try out. They all work as you expect, and have a little different interface than the old Xbox 360. They also launch pretty fast.\n\nGames\nI've been playing Forza a bit, and it is beautiful. The cars look incredible, and the tracks are great.\n\nDead Rising 3 is a very fun game as well. It doesn't necessarily scream next-gen like Forza does, but with the numbers of zombies on the screen and the huge open world, it sure plays like a next-gen game.\n\nRyse is another beautiful game. In my opinion, it plays a bit like Assassin's Creed, but with a shorter story. I feel this is a game that deserves better than most of the reviewers are giving it credit for.\n\nPowerstar Golf is fun, it is like a next-gen Hot Shots Golf if you played those. It is also a download only game from the Xbox Store.\n\nLego Marvel Super Heroes is another good one, this time for the kids. I bought this for my kids and they love it. The graphics are what you expect, but the gameplay is a lot of fun. An open world with over 100 super heroes to play, just a lot of fun to be had.\n\nOverall\nOverall, I think this is a great start for the \"next-gen\". There is a good selection of games out, and some great looking titles coming. And the system itself is great. I did not expect to like or use the voice commands, but they are integrated so well that I have found myself using them. I am excited to see what Microsoft does with updates as there are some annoyances that would be great to see fixed. I am also excited to see what kind of additional features they add in (thinking about the 360 launch, it didn't handle Netflix or any of those apps, they were all added features later on).",

        "comment": "So far, the Xbox One has been an interesting addition to my home theater setup. I'm new to the Xbox world, so backwards compatibility is not an issue for me, but I can see where this would be quite problematic for those with 360's.\n\nWhile the Xbox One is still very new and there are very few games currently available for it, it does seem to have a great deal of potential. However, as with most Microsoft products upon initial release, it is still a bit buggy. I've had several problems with the audio on the optical output becoming garbled upon startup of the system. I can generally fix this by restarting the Xbox, but once I had to reboot it twice before the audio got straightened out. And that leads me to one thing that seems quite strange to me. There doesn't seem to be a way to force the console to reboot other than simply pulling the power plug. The menus allow you to turn it off, but not to restart it.\n\nFinding where things are located in the menus is also a bit difficult as there is no real documentation. One example of this is the setting to enable surround sound. I had to find it by going online and searching for it as it is disabled by default. It is located in the troubleshooting section (of all places) of the audio settings and it is listed as a beta function. I'm not even sure that it is working as the sound coming through the Xbox One still seems to be just stereo enhanced by my surround sound amplifier. Hopefully this will be addressed soon. In over a week of regular use, the system has only crashed once, causing it to automatically restart.\n\nSo, I think that many good things will eventually come to the Xbox One, but there doesn't seem to be much here yet that would cause me to run out and buy one immediately. I'd suggest waiting for it to mature a bit further before seriously considering purchasing one.",

        "comment": "Let me just say that I am very impressed with how well Kinect and Voice Control works. There's something absolutely magical about saying \"Xbox On\" as I enter the room and being signed in and ready to play a game or watch TV by the time I'm sitting down on the couch. And \"Xbox Turn Off\" to shut things down when I'm done. No looking for the remote control. It's amazing how much better something as simple as this makes my entertainment experience.\n\nFrom a gaming perspective, I'm completely immersed in Forza Motorsport 5 at the moment. Amazing graphics. Fast, fluid action. A great online community. A \"Drivatar\" that learns the way I drive and races for me while I'm away. This is what next generation gaming is all about. I'm looking forward to other games in the future, but I want to make sure I give Forza its due time before moving on.\n\nLending to the great gaming experience is the controller. It's a refined version of the Xbox 360 controller. The vibration feedback in the triggers is perhaps what I like best about the new controller. It's subtle, but it really adds to the experience, e.g. in Forza 5, where the triggers now provide feedback when you're loosing traction due to braking or accelerating too hard.\n\nFrom a media experience, Xbox One has it figured out. The experience with Netflix and Amazon Instant is already good. With additional apps coming in the future the media experience is only going to get better. Microsoft truly has built a media platform for the future.\n\nThe only issue I have with Xbox One is the $500 starting price. This is tremendously expensive from a consumer standpoint. For me it was worth getting the console on Day One, but not everyone will feel the same way. To those people I say, give it a year. Xbox One will only get better with software updates and new apps over time. And the hardware price will come down over the life of the console. You can choose to wait, but eventually you owe it to yourself to try this thing out. It's amazing!",

I am a gamer at heart and didn't care for the extra entertainment overview, but once I said \"Xbox On\" and the entire television turned on, I loved it. There are still some issues with different voice controls on the kinect, but the kinect recognizes your voice better each time you use it. I bought Battlefield 4 with the Xbox One and there are many issues with the game such as my campaign restarting, but it is a launch console and a launch game so these problems were expected and they are not horrible. Overall, it is a great entertainment system, but if you are looking for only a gaming console, this still does the job. 4 stars",

Other than that, system is awesome, graphics are great and it's so quiet that you don't even know it's running! Only wish we could play folks on xbox 360 (e.g. Ghosts)...",

I am hoping this can get better as I use the console more.\nThe games I have played on it have all been gorgeous and very smooth to play. Pausing to watch TV and come back to the game is very quick.\nIt does take a bit for games to load initially, but you can start loading a game, watch TV using the TV app, and it will notify you when the game is ready to play. This is only for the initial install of the game, not after it has already been installed.",

        "comment": "After 8 years, the new Xbox One delivers on what many would expect to be a much welcomed advance in gaming, graphics, online experience, smart console, etc. The play is extremely realistic and the graphics delivered are breath taking. The diff between the Xbox and Xbox 360 I noticed most was much brighter everything was. The same is true with the Xbox One over the 360 - the images are so bright and clear and the Kinect is 10x more precise than the last one (which was still good). Great purchase for the family!",

I'm not a big fan of the controller, it feels like the left/right bumpers are up too high and I have to extend my fingers too far up to hit them. Despite all the negative, still enjoy this console WAY more than the ps4. Good investment.",

Everything worked great for a week and the whole family was enjoying the integration with the tv/cable box... (sure some people made a little fun out of \"being so lazy that you'd talk to your tv, instead of using the remote\" but that was part of the fun) but then one day I go to turn it on and it wouldn't respond to the voice command \"Xbox On\"... so I tried to \"manually\" turn it on but it would immediately shut off... Long story short Microsoft is sending me a new one, but I'll be without one for a week :(\nI should have listened to myself and I would wait for all the new HW bugs to be worked out before buying one. Without this issue I would make it a 4 star item and would recommend the buy... There are a couple of other nuances that will need to be worked out (and I'm sure they can in the future with firmware updates) before I'd make this a 5 star item... but I won't get into these now given the circumstances.",

It Plays games it controls my TV (And DVR) it searches the web and feeds me all sorts of info about media and friends activities.\n\nSome of the launch titles are a bit lackluster, and this glut of complaints about 720p vs 1080p certain IS a concern - But things WILL get better. Xbox 360 had a LOT of issues in the beginning - way more than XBO is having.\n\nFor those who love the 360 this is a no-brainer. If you are a hardcore Xbox fan this will not disappoint (eventually). If you're a hardcore Playstation fan, well this won't win you over. Basically PS3 folks; get a PS4, and 360 folks, get a ONE.\n\nThere is no console war, just more of the same with some improvements.

For another amazing feature you can control everything from your phone with the Smart Glass app. All these features create an awesome experience.\nThe not so great is that the software is buggy and at times there is lag and disconnects. The voice control is iffy but works when silent. Once all the kinks get worked out it will good.\nOne thought, why is the 360 market place so much more robust? I understand the game situation, but how about black Friday deals on the X1 for videos and possible arcade action. Let me play my old arcade games on the X1. Overall, I Love it.",

I am very pleased with the system even with the hefty price tag. I am hoping that more games are available soon as not many games are available thus far for the release. It also kind of stinks that the Xbox One is not backwards compatible with previous games. You can also not play the same game online with someone with an xbox 360. They must also have an xbox one to play online together with. Those are my only complaints!",

Not to mention the fact that you can record gameplay on the fly to show off your skills. Its also stupendous that I no longer need a remote to change my tv channel. As if it wasn't hard enough to find the remote and change the channel eh?\n\nThe only downside to this system that I can find aside from an old school VCR appearance is that the kinect sometimes has trouble hearing your voice which in turn leads to poor execution of some commands. I find myself yelling things out just to change the channel. Its fine its 2PM, but not too comforting to neighbors or family members if its 2am. However this is not ALWAYS the case as other times it works without an issue.\n\nWith new technology comes new challenges and I am sure MS will keep improving in its beloved kinect. If you are looking for something that brings together all of your components (TV, Cable Box, Audio Receiver, and Gaming) in harmony then the Xbox One should be your #1 choice here hands down.",

I didn't realize this means the system will actually control your TV, cable/satellite box, and the home theater receiver. Kinect works a lot better than expected even when volume is turned up loud. I would definitely recommend rechargeable batteries as I went through the included controller batteries in just a few days. At launch, there is no way to manually manage save files (I believe an intended anti-piracy/modding measure), so it's weird you can't tell how much space you have left on your hard drive versus how much is actually stored in the online cloud. But this means you can sign on to other consoles without having to bring your memory stick which is a plus.",

The only major problem with the new Xbox is that all the old Xbox games we have don't work on the new system. I think it is ridiculous that you have to buy all new games considering the money we have already spent on games. They will allow you to exchange some of the games and pay a $10 upgrade fee which is nice since several of the games we had were brand new. Still, they should make the games backwards compatible (hence 4 out of 5 stars).",

It seamlessly integrates into social media, TV (through my FIOS box) web browsing, Bluray and DVD watching, netflix and other streaming media apps... and don't forget the games are far superior to what's been available so far.\n\nThis is designed for the person who doesn't necessarily focus on gameplay, but wants to integrate all their media into one location, that can be controlled through motion, remote or voice.\n\nThe motion is leaves a lot to be desired as I spend a lot of my time trying to land \"perfectly\" on the right icon of effect, so I've decided not to use it. I control all my media components by voice and I haven't really had a problem yet.",

Then I popped in my Forza disk and waited and waited and waited over 10 minutes to even \"START\" to play. I played for over 30 minute only to find that the game was still not fully installed. Let the console sit installing for ~15 minutes and the game was only at 80% installed. If everytime you get a new game you have to wait 30 minutes just to play it that will stink. You can pop a disk in a PS4 and play in ~30 seconds.. For having the disk local you think in game load times would be short.. Not the case 2-3 minutes between races to load. Kinect is not without issues but the real value will be determined in games that utilize the features. When Sports comes out I will re-update on the kinect as of right now not impressed.",

The controller feels much better than the 360's controller because the battery pack is now inside the controller instead of protruding out of the back. I honestly can't think of anything bad to say about the xbox one, even when compared to the PS4. I'd comfortably recommend this to anyone.",

It DOES work for controlling your TV, Cable/Satellite box, Audio receiver ETC but it doesn't have any DVR controls currently. Hopefully that gets added soon. You can of course use the remote for your satellite/cable box for DVR functions for the time-being to get around that issue.\n\nOverall, great system and fun to use!",

We went back last night and returned that and purchased the MacBook Air. It is on the higher level of an amount of money, but it is worth every penny. If you don't have the money now for one, save up, do not waste it on any other computer/laptop.\n\nThis computer is fast and easy to set up, it's quick, has a long battery life, and is perfect for a student or professional.\n\nI have had use of Apple products before with a local school I work for, and everything is going to Apple for students and staff to use. So, I had to jump on the band wagon, and I do not regret it at all.\n\nI am very happy with this purchase, it is an investment.",

Overall performance is very good and the quality of launch games is decent...if not great...with a little of something for everyone.\n\nThe interactivity of the console is really cool...and something that anyone can set up and use in a matter of minutes.\n\nIt does have a couple of flaws..but they are things that were similar issues on early 360s..and can easily be remedied thru downloadable updates. One is..the controller has amazing battery life..something like 20+ hrs..but no way to gauge it. The other is...there is no way to see or manage your HD storage..except to look at individual items and add or remove them individually.\n\nAlso, there is a learning curve with the system and virtually no manual to explain how things work.\n\nAll that aside...both the console and controller are of superb quality..and performance is nothing short of fantastic.\n\nAnother hidden value is the availability of 300000 cloud servers, and dedicated servers for all Xbox One games. That is something that is not available on any other console, and is worth the price difference alone over the PS4..in my opinion.\n\nBeing an owner of both a 360 and a PS3..I actually pre purchased both consoles months ago. After trying and comparing both..the X1 is the only one still in my possession...and I think that's saying a lot! The build quality..overall performance..and availability of launch titles makes it a no brainer. The Xbox One is the console to own...now..and for the forseeable future.",

The kinect sensor is magical and recognizes me and my wife in an instant everytime, more so it recognizes my wife quicker than me ;-/ She has been enjoying the Kinect sports and most importantly Kinect fitness with daily challengers and tons of great fat burner and kickboxing routines that are a great workout.

The new kinect is really great! With Xbox live subscription you get the fitness app which basically turns your xbox into a personal trainer for workouts! Super fast and responsive system. Games are great for 1st gen.... nothing special yet but the potential is there for some great games next year! If you want more than a game machine (PS4) this is definitely for you! If you only want a game system and none of the other multimedia junk then go with the PS4. Personally I like the multimedia functions and find it to be much better than just a game system.",

        "comment": "I purchased the Xbox One mainly because of the PS4's lack of multimedia features (DLNA, etc.# although I'm sure a firmware update will add that functionality later. Both systems are pretty much equal in terms of hardware with the exception of the ability of the Xbox One to process incoming video/audio via its HDMI In port. I'm excited by the ability to watch sports with realtime information superimposed over the games I'm watching along with the ability to perform multiple tasks concurrently #play a game and have a web session open looking for strategies for said videogame). Overall I'm very impressed with what Microsoft has created. BTW I also purchased a Playstation 4 as I feel it too has its own distinct advantages. You can't go wrong with either system!",

The exclusive games I picked up are great. Forza, Killer Instinct, Ryse, Dead Rising 3 and soon Titan Fall. The line up of games coming is great. I'm glad Xbox decided to take a chance and push up the bar. This system has many great years ahead and it can only get better. I love that I can watch a NFL game, play a game, while tracking my fantasy football. The tv functionality is great, However make sure you have surround sound to lip sync your tv. This is normal, as I had to do this with my surround sound in the first place. So fare Xbox live has been smooth and very attractive. It runs very quit. I think Xbox has made a very special product, Kinect 2.0 is great to use, I can record in game actions with a simple voice command. Great to upload and let other Xbox friends see your domination of a game. Can't wait for Kinect Sports to launch.",

        "comment": "Before purchasing, I wanted to see some reviews and try both the xbone and ps4. I went with the xbone because I think xbox live is a better user interface than PSN. Another big reason is the Microsoft cloud support,. I wasn't crazy about having to pay for the kinect because I didn't think I'd ever use it. However, the more I use the kinect, the more I like it. What I like best about it is it can be used interactively in game.\n\nAn example is while playing BF4 I can say \"medic\" or \"I need ammo\" to the kinect and my soldier will repeat it in game.....pretty cool. I'm sure this will only get more innovative and supported as games continue to evolve. This is something that the ps4 can't do right now.\n\nI do think the ps4 has slightly better graphics but it's very slight. If you play on a tv smaller than 50\" I don't think you'll even notice. It's not near enough to overcome the user experience that the xbone provides. It's just a more advanced system for the future and the gap will only widen over time. With the cloud support dedicated servers are going to be abundant for just about every game.",

        "comment": "I love my new console. The graphics of the next gen games are fantastic. I highly recommend NBA 2K14, it's not just a slight upgrade from the 360 version, its like a brand new game. One of the best examples of the new graphics. Don't bother with COD:Ghosts if you've played it for 360, there's no real difference. Highly recommend Ryse: Son of Rome as well, very short, but very good.\n\nI didn't think I would use the voice commands as much as I do, but they're great. Really easy to get used to. I would have liked a list of commands out of the box because its kind of tough to navigate if you don't know what to say. Highly recommend using the training they provide you with on the console. Helps with some of the basic commands. Definitely research some commands online, some of the features need the voice commands or are much easier with them. (Hint: one voice command they don't teach you in the training that is very useful, when you snap an app and you want to control the main screen again, say \"Xbox Switch\") The new Kinect features are awesome, my roommate will walk in my room to play games and it recognizes him immediately.\n\nOne issue I do have is that when I bring my Xbox One without the Kinect sensor to a friends house (and lets be honest, you shouldn't bring one anyway, two Kinect sensors on two consoles trying to process one voice command....bad idea!), you have to manually sign in by typing in your credentials, you can't save your credentials because they are linked to the Kinect sign in. That's weird, but only a small annoyance. Another problem with playing with out Kinect is it kind of renders the in game dvr features unusable. Again, small annoyance that will not occur while you have the Kinect plugged in.\n\nThe cloud storage for game saves is a cool new feature. My buddy restored his whole console but when he put in the games after setting up the console again they just loaded up his saves (he had some issues with his Kinect setup, it can be finicky during the setup, mine had no issues but i have heard online about a few people having Kinect issues).\n\nHighly recommend the Xbox One.",

Prior to that, was the monstrosity 360 which I was a 3 time victim of the RROD. After the warranty expired, my 3rd RROD, Microsoft basically said tough.\n\nSo, that's why I went to the PS3. But, the ALL IN ONE NEDIA CENTER that the One is tinkering with lured me back. So, the visuals on the game seem great for my one game (Battlefield 4) and I'm confident as the years pass by. That the PS4's graphics will not BLOW OUT the Ones.....though I'm sure it will be slightly better as it has more graphics horsepower.\n\nVoice control on the kinect is about 75%. Seems like I'm finding myself reaching for the controller more often than not. This is because the Kinect doesn't seem to understand me the 1st or 2nd time. So I find it quicker to use the controller. Hopefully this will be improved as it's a major part of the ALL IN ONE thing Microsoft is touting.\n\nSometimes the ONE won't even turn on my system (game and TV) or it takes 4 times to do it. When it does turn on, I find it VERY annoying that it goes right to the HOME screen as opposed to full screen TV. I'd rather it go right to full TV than the home screen. This is because I use my TV primarily for TV rather than gaming. It would be nice if Microsoft gave the user this option. I find myself annoyed that I'm forced to switch to full TV screen mode with the controller....because it's easier than using the voice control at this point.\n\nOnly other option to keep my TV in full screen mode is to keep my ONE always on and waste electricity. So, if Microsoft improves on the Kinect and the other annoying issues that keep the Kinect and main box from feeling like its ONE PERFECTLY INTIGRATED machine...I think it would be a fantastic success. Right now, it feels like the Kinect and the main box DO NOT mesh very well.\n\nUpdate 12/17/13\n\nVoice control will NOT turn on system via \"Xbox On\" voice command and TV picture freezes which you need to do a hard reboot to correct. This all started after the first update xbox just recently put out. Unacceptable for this to happen to a system that boasts being a media center machine. ONE STAR until they fix this.",

I'm quite impressed by the system, especially that it lets you instantly stop one thing and flip to another, like going from a game to TV. Microsoft finally put a Blu-Ray player in the system too, which is an added bonus.\n\nIt's a bit unfortunate they basically got rid of the Arcade, as I thought that was the 360's best option. While there is still a place to download games, it's just not the same and a bit confusing to navigate at first.\n\nWhile I have all three new systems, Wii U, Xbox and PS4, I would recommend the Xbox to someone that wants more of a Media Center system.",

        "comment": "For the record, I'm just an ordinary guy who likes playing games. I'm not a techie, I don't do this for a living, just your everyday, run of the mill gamer.\n\nOverall it's a great system! The games are beautiful, even at high speeds. The Windows 8 OS looks brilliant and makes things easy to find. The pinning is a very nice touch, it allows a player to truly make the system their own.\n\nHardware: I'm not going to get into the specs, but the actual hardware is beautiful. It is a very low profile piece of machinery, the black with white lighted accents adds to any decor. It is no bigger than your average cable box from your satellite or cable provider. The controls have a unique feeling to them, that can only be described as \"nice\"! And the controller's rumble triggers really bring games to life! The kinect uses some impressive tech, to take your gaming experience to the next level, with it's facial recognition to sign in and the ability to use you voice to do an array of things! The Xbox One is pretty quiet, if not for the lights, you could forget it's even on, which is a plus. None of the power buttons are raised, they all flush with the system and powering on resembles using a touch screen device. It was a breeze to set up, 2 cables, power and one to the TV. The power source is still rather bulky, but they have made it lighter, smaller, and a joy to look at.\n\nSoftware: As I said earlier, it uses the Windows 8 OS, and the windows explorer makes use of the much needed flashplayer. I will not discuss the specifics, as I am no computer science, or software major. It comes with an impressive 500GB of memory, which will be needed once you start buying games, because the Xbox One downloads the entire game to your console, however, you still need the actual disc to play. The store on the Xbox One is great, music, TV shows, and games, all at the push of a button. There are really cool apps to download, pretty much all of the major apps are available, such as Hulu plus, netflix, redbox, FOX, the CW and soooooooo many more! It comes stock with some very useful apps, such as snap, where you can have a type of picture in picture, where you can do two things at once, be it watch TV and play a game, or surf the web and watch TV, or whatever combination you can think of. I was a little disappointed in the functionality of the OneGuide and TV viewing. You can plug your cable box in and it automatically detects what it is, until it doesn't. I believe my box was manufactured in 2008, which is older, granted, but it works perfectly, just not with the Xbox One. I couldn't the console to operate my box, or television, as promised. I was quite frustrated. But I just decided not to use my box and console in tango until either I update to a new box, or Microsoft pushes out a new update to make older items work. But the things the Xbox One could do with my television and cable box SOUND awesome, if you are fortunate to make these items works in concert, then I would recommend it! Using the kinect and the stock app Upload, you can record game clips with your voice or with the in game DVR, and then share it, which is very cool!\n\nHighlights: Voice Control\nFacial Recognition\nBeautful Graphics and Beautuful Design\nAwesome Functionality\nGreat Apps\nHours Upon Hours of Fun\nA Joy to Have For Any and Everyone\n\nShortcomings: Compatibility with any and all televisions as well as cable/satellite boxes\nI shouldn't have to wait long for a game to load when the entire game is saved to the console.\nYou would think that such a futuristic system that acts like a computer would be able to not only recognize, but view, extract, play, and add things to an external hard drive. And oh by the way, the Xbox One is made by Microsoft, a computer software/hardware giant!\n\nQuite the piece of machinery if you ask me, I am very pleased with my purchase and wouldn't even think of taking it back or getting rid if it. The good definetly overshadows the bad in my opinion. I hope this was helpful! Now get the Xbox One and get gaming! You'll thank yourself later, and others will thank you as well.",

        "comment": "Potentially, this has the ability to be a game changer.\n\nAs of right now, it is clear that MS wants to nose its way into your living room, and it wants to step right in between the path of your DirecTV/cable box and and your TV...literally. I'll get more into that shortly...\n\nThe box itself is not entirely different than the Xbox consoles of the past. Kind of big, kind of bulky, but it's really not that big of a deal. Yes, there is a power brick, but again, I'm not going to let that keep me from buying a console. The console, when on, makes no sound what so ever. I've been very impressed with the length of time it takes to turn itself on and my other components. The IR blaster generally does what it's supposed to do - turn on the Xbox One along with the Kinect, the TV, the Onkyo receiver, and the DirecTV DVR. You enter the model numbers for your components when you first set up your console, and you shouldn't have to do it again. \"Xbox On\" and \"Xbox Turn off\" do the job for all of your components.\n\nThe item that has been making all the news has been the live TV integration. This aspect is the most impressive and maddening all at the same time. It is very cool to be able to have your friends come over, and you just use your voice to say, \"Xbox volume up,\" \"Xbox watch ESPN,\" \"Xbox Turn Off,\" etc., it have your guests' jaws drop. It's also maddening that you can give some of the same commands and occasionally just get ignored, at which point, your wife just shakes her head and wonders aloud, \"what's so great about this again?\" It's also mildly frustrating that some channels like \"ESPN U\" and \"Disney Junior\" cannot be accessed by voice; so that means that your DirecTV/Cable remote cannot go that far away. Let the record indicate that I just found out last night after having had this for since \"Day One\" that the d-pad on the controller can be used to go channel up or channel down. That certainly lessens the need for the DirecTV/Cable remote to be around at all times. The \"Xbox One Guide\" is a glorified alternative to your existing on-screen guide. I don't know exactly yet how to use my voice to tell it to tune to a particular channel from the guide, but the page up/page down commands work very well through the \"One Guide.\"\n\nA second question I had about TV integration was going to be the picture quality when passing through the Xbox One. It turns out that it looks really good, and 99% of the time, it's flawless. The only time I notice anything amiss is when I'm paying attention to the \"ESPN Bottom Line\" - the scroll bar at the bottom of any ESPN channel. Every once in a blue moon I notice a little judder effect on the text as it scrolls. It's still very readable, and after a few seconds, it corrects itself, but it's occasionally noticeable. The actual TV content is excellent in terms of picture quality. One tip for you if you have a cable/satellite box that allows you to alter your resolution from 720p to 1080i or vice versa, then go ahead a pick one that you think is best and avoid a \"native\" mode at all costs. (Personally, I like 1080i the most between the two, but your opinion may vary). The reason I say that is because the Xbox takes a few seconds to go from one resolution to the other, and it's noticeably longer than it is when the signal is going directly from cable/satellite box to TV. The good news is that the signal, regardless of the resolution you choose, is getting upconverted to 1080p anyway. For the record 3D signals do not pass through from the DirecTV DVR through the Xbox and to the TV. The TV will now give you the \"Your TV does not support 3D\" message if you pass through the Xbox. Either have a second HDMI connection directly from your cable/satellite box to your TV, or give Microsoft some time to correct this issue. We never use 3D, much like most of America; so I suspect this will not impact you at all.\n\nOne negative that does affect me slightly is that, at this moment, Dolby 5.1/7.1 is not supported output via optical cable, only DTS. I have HDMI connected, and Dolby 5.1/7.1 is supported via HDMI, but my audio receiver is slightly older, and it only passes through the video signal, not audio, thus my having to use optical. Many of you will not have to worry about this at all, but my rear speakers go unused in regular TV watching for 7.1. There is supposed to be an Xbox update coming soon that will address this issue. If your HDMI carries both audio and video for you, then you can ignore this paragraph. If you rely on optical, then know that audio during gameplay is 7.1 (stunningly good, by the way), but TV watching is DTS (soon to be updated/upgraded).\n\nThe Kinect sensor is really cool as far as I can tell in gameplay. The only games I have are Battlefield 4, Madden NFL 25, NBA 2k14, and Forza 5. I don't have any full-blown motion games that really take advantage of being able to detect your movements. In gameplay, the only real tests I've given the Kinect have been to audible in Madden (very accurate), holler \"throw grenade\" in Battlefield (excellent), and use profanity in NBA 2K14 (which appropriately gets you T'd up!). I do know the Kinect camera is very clear, and it does a pretty good job of picking up people in the room and associating their gamer pic with them. I get the customary \"Hi, Sarfdawg\" every time it sees me.\n\nOn to the reason you bought this...the actual gameplay...\n\nGraphically, it is noticeably improved over the Xbox 360 for Battlefield, Forza, and NBA 2k14. If fact, those three games are stunningly good. The attention to detail on all of those games is remarkable, particularly in Forza and NBA 2K14. I think Battlefield was already amazing on the 360 version because it was made at the tail end of the life cycle for the 360 and on the front end of the Xbox One life cycle.\n\nThis doesn't have a whole lot to do with the Xbox One console itself, but EA should be embarrassed by the Madden product they produced for the Xbox One. I had the 360 version of Madden and traded up to get the Xbox One version, and to say that it's a direct port from the 360 version would be an insult to the 360 version. Many of the cool things about the 360 version were mysteriously left out of the Xbox One version, particularly the pregame intro videos that were on the 360. Beyond that, the best thing that can be said about the Xbox One Madden is that it's the only football game going on Xbox One. I presume that subsequent year's versions will be better as EA figures out how to utilize the graphical power of the Xbox One. Forza and NBA 2K14 need to be automatic purchases as they are clearly made for this console and show off it's power. I'm not even a big NBA fan, and I strongly recommend it just for showing off the console itself.\n\nIf you owned the 360 version from its inception (2005 or 2006, I can't remember), then you know the games got much better as its life cycle got longer. I suspect that a year, two years from now, the games on the Xbox One will be out of this world. I'm not at all a PC gamer, so you folks may just snicker at that comment. But, for me as an occasional console gamer, I think the Xbox One has its best days in front of them for a long while.\n\nMicrosoft has promised many updates to fix some of the issues that are cropping up, and I have no reason to doubt them. They made good on many of the issues that plagued the 360, and they have not been passed on to the Xbox One. As minor as the issues are on the Xbox One, I have no reason to believe that they won't address them as they did on the Xbox 360. I've read Cnet and others say that you should wait to get the Xbox One and the PS4 for that matter. I'm not entirely sure why you should punish yourself and wait. The updates are all streamed down through the internet, and there is no talk of improving hardware in future iterations at all. If you want one now, get one. Be patient and enjoy it for what it is. You will enjoy it straight out of the box, and I feel certain you can rest assured this will only get better.\n\nIf I think of anything else that would be pertinent, I will update as we go. Feel free to ask questions as you wish. Hopefully, you have found this helpful. Merry Christmas, all.",

So believe me - this is some real hatred and not some PS4 wanna be posting stuff. I have console for over 2+ weeks now, and it just keeps getting worse.\n1. The TV feature sounds great but in reality = You have to pass the video signal through the Xbox, it is not a passive device - meaning the Xbox must be on to pass the video. So you have to buy a HDMI splitter and split it from the video source = then you can watch TV like normal through your AV receiver for example - and not have the XBOX on.\n2. Wanna listen to your .mp3's on your USB stick? = forget about it.. Wont do it. (forums advise you to post your request for a future APP# = what a joke.. Xbox 360 could do it..\n3. I'm trying to get used to the new \"dashboard\". But is is NOT user friendly. about as handy as Linux to a Windows user. Really bad!\n4. Want to Snap that TV iamge to the side and continue to use the Xbox One to surf the net or just surf the Dashboard? = good luck.. There is NO INSTRUCTIONS on how to do the main feature they say is so great.. You have to go do some searching and figure out how to do it. # once the video is snapped to the side = then you hit the Big button on the controller to activate the other side features.. Poor interface/dashboard/help..\n5. Game load times is pretty slow for a Next Gen console. ( if you die in the game - it takes awhile to try again..just saying = WOW, what a disappointment. I should think they figured out how to make it faster by now.\n6. Look at how few games are available = NOT many at all.\n7. No accessories really out there yet. No chat/keyboard pad add on yet like the 360 had.\nOverall, they rushed the system. Should of had the APPS ready to do the basics, more games, more accessories and refined the windows 8 wanna be interface.. Just read the Xbox forums for the many disappointing issues!",

They could have allowed companies to work with the xbox sooner to allow them to be available at release but for some reason did not. This may have been for the best we don't know but hey no ones perfect.\n\nAlso it was said before that the xbox is hard to develop for similar to how the ps3 was compared to the 360 last time which is why games aren't running at 1080p at the moment. Again could have been prevented but too late now.\n\nIt is a great console just needs some updates. In all seriousness if you want to buy a console and aren't sure which to get it comes down to who you want to give your money to. The prices are similar if you were to buy a PS4 camera similar to the kinect then you would be paying very similar prices.\n\nI do plan to buy a PS4 this is not me smack talking the PS4 they are both great consoles and you can't go wrong either way.",

I love how everything goes through the HDMI in from my cable box. I can go from Live TV to Netflix to battlefield to music to YouTube in literally seconds. There is some getting used to the right voice commands. Anyone who says they don't work probably aren't saying the right commands. Once you use the right commands, I've had about 90% luck with it working correctly. The games are great but being able to snap Live NFL while playing battlefield 4 is absolutely my idea of next gen and can't wait to see how Microsoft evolves this machine even further in the future.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "It's been 8 years since the release of the Xbox 360. The wait has been the longest in the industry for a new generation of hardware and now that it's finally here, the decision as to whether you should commit to that shiny new console can seem a bit overwhelming.\n\nThe first thing to understand is the Xbox One's launch software has more in common with the previous generation because many of the cross-platform games like Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty Ghosts were developed with the lowest system requirements in mind (read: PS3 and Xbox360). Many of the games don't show the true potential of the system just yet, but there are still a number of factors that should sway you to make that leap to getting the console.\n\nThe Xbox One offers some features never attempted in console gaming before. Integration of television services, streaming of digital content, DVR for game sessions, Skype from your living room and the comfort of your couch. All of these features are part of what makes the Xbox One different from the rest of the console gaming crowd. The Kinect 2.0 camera is another feature that sets the system apart from consoles like the PS4 since it is standard with the console and makes up a large part of the additional $100 over the price of the PS4. The extra $100 is easily justified since the Kinect integrates everything unlike any other gaming console before it and you have to see it in action to appreciate it.\n\nAs mentioned above, the first wave of software is not as impressive as many would have liked, but there are still some shining examples of next-gen quality graphics in Forza Motorsport 5, Killer Instinct and Ryse: Son of Rome, which is hands-down the best looking game on any console! Rest assured, as we enter the new year, the justification for getting that new console will become more apparent with developers shifting to making their games specifically for the Xbox One and they learn to code games more efficiently for the console to make them look and play better than ever before.\n\nIf you are looking for that next-generation system, and if you are looking for a console that breaks tradition and does something a bit different, then the Xbox One is the console you should be considering right now!",

There are too many oddities that occur for the money spend on this hardware. Graphics are great, controller is good, and games are good but lacking on launch. The entertainment control of my TV and equipment turned out to be surprisingly awesome. However after a week it stopped working. I was getting lots of TV not found or some error similar to that. The voice commands are also spotty. They work then they dont then I forget what the very specific commands need to be. I still like that I have it but for the price I really expected this to just work seamlessly.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I converted to a Mac last year when my company started offering us a choice that included Macs. My first Mac is a MacBook Air and here are reasons why I would recommend the Air:\n\n1. Battery life is incredible! I can easily get 12-14 hours of actual usage before it needs to be charged. Plus the charging is also very quick. I am getting better battery use out of the Air than most tablets out there.\n\n2. The machine is fast and silent! I love the instant on and off. This has more to do with how the Mac OS works, but still it makes a difference. It literally is as fast to turn on and off as a tablet, but you have all the power of a 13 inch laptop.\n\n3. The keyboard and mouse are simply great. There is no other notebook or tablet keyboard that can come close. The mouse on this is incredible and the multiple touch works flawlessly.\n\n4. I really like the Mac OS. I like how easy everything is and there are no annoying pop ups asking me to update this and that on a continuous basis. Plus unlike my windows laptops it doesn't slow down and I don't need to do any maintenance on the software to make it run smoothly all the time.\n\n5. Love the design and build quality. Very minimalist and classy looking.\n\nBug and other issues:\n\n1. As someone has pointed out, the laptop can randomly go to sleep and requires a hard reset to wake. It's happened to me a couple of time. But in both cases no info was lost and it takes only around 30 seconds to wake from a full reset (if not less). My guess is that this is a bug due to the aggressive battery savings built in. It only happens when you are not connected.\n\nOthers:\n\n2. The screen isn't retina so the MacBook Pro with retina may appeal more to some. However, the screen quality is pretty good since it has sub pixel smoothing and other enhancements that make text look sharper. This sort of optimization can only be done on a fixed orientation display (not a tablet), therefore a laptop with lower resolution can actually have a better display than a tablet with a higher pixel density display because the laptop display can be optimized.\n\n3. This isn't a touch screen laptop, but I prefer not to touch the screen of my laptops. The excellent multi touch mouse pad on the Air makes it actually a better touch interface than the touch screen laptops.\n\nNet: once you start using a MacBook Air it's hard going back to anything else. Perhaps the retina MacBook Pro, but that gets you a better display at the cost of 2-4 hours of battery life. I'll take the battery life and better performance of the Air.",

I find myself constantly having to repeat certain things, and i still have the hardest time turning on the console with my voice. For the most part it does a good job and is fun to interact with stuff just by voice. I did notice that while playing some games if i paused it and someone made noise in the background the kinect would unpause my game while i away from the tv. The only other downfall i have is that it takes a lot longer to download and install games than my PS4. I got home ready to play some dead rising 3, only to have to wait about 45 minutes to install only a 5 gb update. Overall i think Microsoft has a wonderful idea of being able to control all your entertainment stuff from the XB1 but right now they just need to work out all the kinks.",

I had the 2011 macbook pro originally. it is a great computer but after awhile its weight started to become an issue. I wanted something lighter, with great battery life and great specifications so it was between the retina macbook pro and the macbook air. I decided on the air because its the lightest and the battery life is superb. The retina display is great on the macbook pro but it is not a necessity for me. The screen on the macbook air is still great without it being retina.\n\nI have had the problem of the macbook air going into sleep mode and then not waking up needing a hard reset in order for it to be usable again. It doesn't happen often tho and i know there will be a patch out soon enough to fix this issue so no worries there. Thats the only issue i have had with this monster of a machine.\n\nOverall, the macbook air is GREAT... by the way, i opted for the 4GB memory and 128GB hard drive model. I am good with that much memory, plus i have the new 3TB Airport Time Capsule that i store everything on. My onboard memory is hardly used.\n\nGREAT LAPTOP and having a Airport Time Capsule with it is a KILLER addition. You can back up everything on your Time Capsule using time machine and with file sharing you can have access to ALL your files ANYWHERE you go. You should need nothing more.",

After the initial first run or two when you wanted to play with your friends is where the pain began. They try to force you into using kinect for snap and almost seem to make it a pain to open snap without. There are other little problems. For example, when you try to play two players on one xbox the controllers will swap profiles for no reason. When I would pass certain menus it would pass control to my brother as my profile... EXTREMELY frustrating. Those are just a couple things and on top of all that my mic died when it was not even a month old. Over all I am not happy with my Xbox one.

If you are playing multiplayer games without a head set other players can yell Xbox Off and your game goes to the shut off screen and will shut off if they yell Yes afterwards. The graphics are not worth a $500 purchase. It doesn't connect to your computer media like the 360. It really has nothing special to offer that works correctly.\nYou must install your games to the hard drive and that takes close to 30 minutes. It will control your tv and cable box but doesn't work correctly at all. It will power up your tv but wont switch the inputs of the tv in case you have multiple systems hooked up. Most time giving the command to shut off power leaves the tv power on. For the price a gaming computer would be a better investment.",

All of the many features are amazing, youtube! netflix! hulu! amazon prime! espn! nfl! fantasy football! blu ray player! gaming! more apps! kinect! skype! console and controller look so fancy classy! this new console is amazing, nothing wrong at all. graphics arent much improved but playstation i hear isnt much better either and they have nothing to offer but gaming and a boring navigation screen with boring and way less apps. So i recommend everyone to buy this!!! I also recommend cod ghosts! its a great game.",

        "comment": "Games will play great, and they do look next gen; however, the selling point of the xbox one was its ability to unify your tv/cable/dish in a seamless user controlled voice/gesture interface. Kinect does not always 'hear' you correctly, sometimes it just does not respond at all. In the age of Siri, Dragon, and other voice recognition software, Kinect takes a step backward and disappoints. For instance, to turn the device on via voice command you have to be standing less than a foot away from Kinect so that it can recognize your voice and turn the system on. Gesture commands are sometimes cumbersome and perhaps the system is too sensitive to your movements so any gestures that require specific screen locations are hard to achieve.",

I never drop connection when viewing Hulu or Netflix, problems I had with a new Blu-Ray player I've since given away (my pizza delivery guy had a nice tip the night I setup the Xbox One!!!#. My family loves being recognized upon entering the family room by the Xbox!\nI was awestruck by the simplicity with which the Xbox One integrated with my soundbar, my satellite box, and my television; I expected flaws since the Xbox One is so new. Overall, I'm very satisfied with this purchase and cannot wait for the onslaught of games to follow #Bethesda, I'm looking at ES Online for the One now)...",

There aren't very many games for the console.

Set up was easy, only took a minute or two to conect all the cables and fire it up.\n\nGraphics, in the games released so far is excellent. I have Forza 5, Battlefield 4, COD: Ghost, Ryse: Son of Rome and Killer Instinct, the last being free. There are a few minor issues, maily related to games being fine tuned, as well as Kinnect not always responding correctly to voice commands. But it's a brand new gaming system and with games and the Xbox being as complex as they are a few hiccups are not unexpected.\n\nIf you were an Xbox 360 user and your still on the fence I would definetly recomend the Xbox One and give it the full five stars.\n\nBeing a new systems, there are only a handful of games out",

        "comment": "Let me preface this by stating I own both the XBOX ONE and PS4. In my opinion, both consoles were rushed to the market and the software is lacking. Both do not let you play and music/videos off a USB drive. This is a major downfall when the console is supposed to be an all-in-one media center. Also, the TV aspect with Kinect command did not work great for me. The lack of LOW POWER passthrough killed this for me and I've since removed the Cable Box from the XBOX. The Kinect Voice commands are spotty at best for me. I feel that this console would be great for a bachelor that does not care about screaming at his video game console. If you have kids that sleep, some of these features may not be utilized that well if for some reason their bedrooms are close.\n\nOverall, I think the console has the potential to be GREAT, but just felt rushed initially. The games are good though, Dead Rising 3 is a really fun game to accompany the console.",

        "title": "Xbox Live is broken...and kinect is annoying", 
        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I'll start with my first issue (xbox live) which was my initial reason for choosing the Xbox one over the PS4. In the previous generation the online party system and overall friends list was far superior on the 360 when compared to the PS3 (I owned both). However the \"new\" xbox live on the xbox one is so broken that party voice chat still to this day does not work at all (December 28th)...so it's been out for over a month with no fixes. I've used the skype app as a work around, but overall the online experience has been horrific. My second issue is how Microsoft has clearly built the xbox one to be used with voice command. Which in some circumstances is fine, but when it's 2:30 am and all I want to do is check my friends list, I'd prefer to not wake my roomate up yelling \"xbox go to friends\" in the living room. What they've done is baried simple things like the friends list and other simple things to force you to ask the kinect to direct you to it. Half the time the kinect can't figure out what your asking for, and about 90 percent of the time your left pretty upset. Don't get me wrong, the first day it was pretty cool to say \"xbox on\" and have it boot up on its own, but after that it only goes down hill. The tv integrated thing is fine, but I can see an obvious delay when trying to change channels which is annoying (I have comcast).\n\nTo sum it up if what you want is an easy, faster, and more user friendly gaming experience then I suggest you go with the PS4 this time around (and that's coming from someone who normally leaned towards xbox in terms of gaming). Now in days things are normally patched and fixed over time, but I feel stupid for paying $100 dollars more for something that is clearly broken in many areas. I'll wait and hope that these things are fixed over time, but I can't recommend this console to anyone as it stands. (Also Microsoft, if you are reading this, please don't send a hit man to silence me.)",

I love the voice communication and the early indications of the updated Kinect capability are that it is considerably more responsive and sensitive than its predecessor. I had none of the issues that plagued a small percentage of the new systems and neither did the sister unit in Florida. Skype connections were established fairly quickly and while all my Skype contacts migrated adding new connections was a bit more involved as I learned the button functionality. Switching back and forth between games and settings while on Skype was a bit dodgy as well. I had two lock ups where the unit just ceased to respond; once while updating a game (it was stuck for over an hour at the same download percentage) and once when attempting to read a blue ray disc after installing the blue ray disc app (it just sat on the Blue Ray screen for ten minutes before I tired of waiting and switched it off). In both cases the unit came back up and responded properly after the restart.\nInitial lack of X-Box Live multiplay on the family game bought (Legos Marvel Superheroes) have us waiting to play a game together.\nOverall, the speed, functionality and capability tied with the current and anticipated game titles make this the best selection for my needs.",

The Kinect Sensor could sometimes be a bit annoying, if this is the reason why Microsoft priced it much higher than Sony's PS4 in my opinion they should have left the Kinect out for individual sell.\n\nCurrently there is a short library of games just like any other new system that would come out on the market. However the few games that are out are great this is from someone that owns seven of those games.",

I was able to hook it up to my entire home theater system and now all I have to do is say \"Xbox on\" and it turns everything on, then I can say \"watch TV, what's on HBO\" and it'll bring up the guide for my DirecTV and I can watch whatever I want without needing a remote. It is pretty awesome until it hiccups and decides it doesn't hear you or see your hand for using hand gestures. It mostly works pretty well other than a hiccup here or there, I'm very glad we got this over the PS4 even if I wanted a PS4, but couldn't find one.",

        "comment": "I was a proud owner of an Xbox 360 and a PS3 - my PS3 was pretty much used exclusively as a bluray player because there were very few games that intrigued me that were PS3 exclusives and I preferred xbox live. When they announced the Xbox One, I thought my prayers had been answered - xbox live + bluray drive. I snagged my Day 1 edition with a couple of assorted games and I have to say I am impressed. I didn't buy a kinect sensor for my 360 because from toying with it in store and at a friends house it seemed glitchy and in some cases really irritating. The Kinect that came with the Xbox One seems like what they were shooting for when they first released Kinect - solid motion capture, fairly impressive voice recognition and controls that actually improve the overall user experience. Don't get me wrong, there are still going to be moments when you think about taking it for a dip in the bathtub, but all in all it gets the job done. Not having to turn on a controller just to watch Netflix is excellent. As far as gaming is concerned, the video quality is beautiful - Forza, in particular, is impressive because of the attention to detail - not only do the cars and tracks look gorgeously life-like, but the physics required to constantly render the effects and allow for rewind capability are excellent. Dead Rising 3 is probably my favorite - the story isn't fantastic, the voice acting and some of the bit part characters are pretty terrible but the gameplay is a blast. The Boom Bear in particular has become my new BFF - like having your own personal death squad plush toy. If they ever make a deal with the major cable providers to allow the XB1 to act as a DVR instead of as a go-between for voice control of your cable box I think Sony will have to pull up their tent pegs. Impressive product, Microsoft - keeping tweaking the OS to make all the functions of the 360 cleaner.",

It really does everything they claim-- it is the lynchpin of my living room. It is a single source for video games, streaming video services (Netflix, Amazon, etc.), and my cable TV provider (DISH). As the father of two small children, being able to switch between these entertainment sources seamlessly, using nothing but my voice, is a win. Also the Skype app is unparalleled and made Christmas day apart from my family very special. It really does feel like the future.",

        "comment": "Had to get away from sprint and the spotty service and message delivery so I was glad to get back to Verizon as their coverage is so much better. They had a great promo on the Samsung s3 so I got it. Less than 3 weeks later they put the same promo on the s4 which really irritated me. I just got the phone set up to suit me and spent $20 some dollars on ringtones and didn't want to go through it again. The s3 has some good features and some bad ones. If your not real careful you'll go to use it and find all your pages have changed, more steps to pull up a contact and the auto suggest in messaging really sucks, it refuses to let me use things like ty nor will it learn it. I have to reread everything so I ended up turning it off which means I now have to manually do my punctuation which sucks but better than sending garbled unintelligible messages. The only 2 features better than the evo are the camera quality although every time I try to send photos it won't convert to msm and I get the red exclamation mark and it says all videos even 20 second ones are too large to send. The second great feature is the microphone, I love it for memos, sending bulk personal happy holiday texts. I'll live with the phone to get the better service.",

Tried to register everyone for a live account so they can all particpate and I was unable to register more than 3 in one day. Said to try again the next day. Not sure its going to let me. Graphics are phenomenal. The voice activation seems to work well. I love the fact that I can control my TV and receiver with it also.

Now, they both communicate on the same 192 number without any problems.

Out in practice, I was still using my 2007 Sony Vaio which must have weighed 10 pounds, had about 5-6 minutes of battery life, and worst of all needed updates every 8 minutes. I finally took the dive when the MacBook Air went on sale right before Thanksgiving. I was able to get the 13\" for less than the cost of an 11\" so it was hard to pass up. Well, I can honestly say, aside from my car, this has been my best work related purchase ever! I charge it every two days or so, I take it everywhere! All you have to do is open it and it's ready to go which is amazing. The screen clarity and sound are amazing, and I love all the keyboard controls for sound, brightness, etc. I also love the seamless operating with my iPhone and iPad Mini; literally, you do X on your phone and it's immediately available on the computer and iPad. The built in camera is nice since we are facing a switch to video conferences and depositions. The speed is great and it never ever freezes up or makes me wait. Just overall, a very pleasant experience. Oh, and I bought a great snap on cover on Amazon for like $12, and it works like a charm!",

        "comment": "i think its hilarious microsoft would make a play for the cable industry.. when over the last couple of years the cable companys have seen 1.5 million subscribers drop per year cutting the cord and just paying for netflix, hulu ect.. so personally i dont enjoy more than half of this new software they've installed.. i've always have had an xbox in the house and use it daily, but its predecessor the 360 was very refined, you knew where everything was and comparing this new one there's really a big difference..\nplus the the way it excepts disc is aweful. ive noticed light scratches on my new games already just from loading them.. the did away with the tray and now you have to slip them into a what reminds of a car cd player... as matter of fact im taking another star away.. i noticed people were so quick to give it five stars the day they picked it up.. i waited to do this review now from about a months worth use..\ni will say its quieter than my other xboxs but it still come with a brick on the plug end so id say give it 10-12 months and i bet it will have a loud humm to it after awhile of collecting some dust..\nover-all im actually hardly impressed.. for 500 bucks i could have done allot with that money this christmas season.. oh well..\none laast thing, i bought call of duty ghosts a few days ago and thought i was buying the new xbox one version, didn't realize it waas for the older 360, you think they would have done a better job of changing the color of the cases.. really just not happy with that.. people might think im an itiot for buying it, but having a four year old tugging on my sleeve and my wife wanting to get going, i just didnt even think, but i think when your a consumer of a particular product from a particular company the products should be more easily identified when selecting something on the go.. well thats my review, i could actually go on for another couple paragraphs but ill digress.. thanks for reading..",

        "comment": "I was recently in the market for a new laptop and was initially planning on getting another windows laptop as they are much cheaper. However, everyone I know that made the switch from Windows to Apple was very pleased with the decision &amp; would not go back to the Windows laptop. It was at least twice as twice as much to buy the Mac Air. I'm glad I made the switch. I use the laptop for work and personal and just find that it is easier to use and less buggy than Windows. My windows machines always seem to get buggy and slow unless you really stay on top of it with the virus software. I don't hear about these virus problems as much from Apple users and so far that has been my experience as well after about a month of use. I don't get the the \"Windows is searching for a solution\" message (Windows never finds a solution in my experience). Also, you can now exchange Microsoft Office files between the Apple and Window machines which is great for work. In summary, great synchronization between the iPhone, iPad &amp; Macbook Air, thin, lightweight, stable &amp; great battery life. It's worth the extra money. I'd buy it again.",

This is typical, but I expect as March rolls around we will be seeing some very interesting and wonderful titles. The incorporation of pass through HDMI and the ability to Skype while playing are pretty neat. I also enjoy being able to issue more commands through the Kinect without having a dedicated microphone. Definitely worth the purchase (especially come March when more developed titles will be released. (One CON of this generation of titles is that the games must be downloaded to the hard drive, then updated, before any gameplay can begin...while this may be a technical issue, it is a big hassle and will soon cause frustration as a user's library grows.)",

I've got it set to turn my tv and audio receiver on and off whenever I tell my console to turn on and off. I only use my tv for the Xbox, so it doesn't bother me if I turn my tv of and on with the console, but if you've got separate programming to watch or another console I can see where that wouldn't be something that you would want to do.\n\nThe only cons are expected since it's still close to launch and I would imagine will be fixed in future updates and game availability. The voice commands for the connect can be really annoying at times. I've had to repeat myself a couple to a few times every now and then. The only other complaint I have is that the launch didn't feature many games that I enjoy playing. Other than that I would highy recommend upgrading to the Xbox One.",

I love that I don't have to use the garbage Comcast UI for the guide, and can do everything I need with one HDMI port though the Xbox One (with the exception of my Apple TV for Airplay). The Voice commands work much better than I expected, but their is aways room for improvement. It moves very fast between Apps. I am not a huge gammer, I just play some COD and FIFA. Those two games are great on Xbox One. If you want a console that does everything, I recommend the Xbox one. People that get the PS4 are only looking for something that plays games and want to save $100.",

        "comment": "This MacBook Air is a great purchase for someone who wants a lightweight computer that will last for long hours. When I first purchased this product, I was amazed by the amount of battery life it contained. Downsizing from a MacBook Pro 15\" to the MacBook Air 13\" was a great decision since I no longer wanted a heavy product to tote around. Although this computer has a lot of great things about it, I don't like that the power cable detaches a lot easier than my MacBook Pro. It's not a huge issue but something to consider if you're doing a lot of moving around. The MacBook Air also scratches easily, so be careful if you want your computer to look perfect. I'm not a huge fan of the speakers on this computer either, but they're still pretty decent. If I ever have the volume turned up high, the speakers feel like they might blow. They're placed differently than my previous computer, so that's why I've reached that conclusion.",

No trial program, or half the program, you have to buy the rest. Yes it costs a little more, but I think in the long run it is worth it. When you turn it on, it is a matter of seconds and you are up and running. When you turn it off, It is off by the time you close it. Unlike my old laptop that is constantly updating something.",

The without an Ethernet port, I had to purchase an adaptor that I only use on the rare occasion where I stay at a hotel without wifi. Additionally, the design of the MacBook Air doesn't permit the inclusion of disc drive. Like an Ethernet port, it's rarely used now. However, when it is, unless you have the portable disc drive (additional $70-80), you have to go through the pain of transferring files to a portable hard drive or via email to the computer.\nDon't get me wrong; minor gripes aside, the MacBook Air is a highly capable computer that can do everything work related that I need it too. It has a phenomenal battery life and all the bells and whistles i could want without the additional costs and extraneous options on the MacBook Pro.",

The other problem is while playing live you get a bunch of people yelling at their xbox one to switch to game. Other than that it works very well and is very fast. I'm very happy.",

        "comment": "So I bought both the PS4 and X1... I'm a game fan, not a fan-boy. Both machines had a glitch or two at launch (and still have some), seemingly more than any other console(s) at launch that I recall. This is probably due to the extensive dependency on hooks to web content, or maybe the complexity of the OS (or both).\n\nOverall I like the X1 well enough, but it seems to lack personality (so to speak). The controller is very nice, but the W8 GUI just doesn't excite me, and the Kinect is a major annoyance to me in a number of respects. I have it mostly disabled, which addresses some of my annoyance, but using that setting I have to sign in every time I turn on the machine - PIA.\n\nOK, I'm sure I will like this Xbox just as much as I've enjoyed the first two, in due time. Hopefully MS addressed the QC/design issues this time around and we don't all start seeing unit failures. For now, I can't help but feel that the PS4 will ultimately be the better 'game' machine, long-term. Not hatin'... just sayin'.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "What I like:\n+ The dashboard is integrated WAY better than the Xbox 360 and PS3. There is no longer the feeling of \"in a game\" or \"in the dashboard\". You are ALWAYS in both. Say you are in the middle of a game but want to spontaneously change a system setting or launch another app etc. Both the 360 and PS3 had some semi-dashboard functionality built into the dashboard/home button, but most everything required you to first exit the game and go to the dashboard (aside from some shortcuts to go straight to a different game). Now, you press the dashboard button and without interrupting your game in any way, you now have access to the full dashboard and settings, etc. There is really no such thing as being required to \"quit\" a game anymore, which is awesome.\n\n+ Speed. I always was surprised that through the entire life of the Xbox 360 (including the 360 S and 360 E), there was an unacceptable amount of lag on many core dashboard functions. Something as basic as showing your list of games, or list of gamerpics to change to, or achievement lists, or loading marketplace screens, would often take several seconds of waiting to populate. The Xbox One's startup is acceptably fast, but could still be improved on, but basic things like loading marketplace content or my list of installed apps, achievements, etc, is very quick. Switching between game and dashboard is no longer the slow annoyance it used to be, but rather is nearly instantaneous.\n\n+ The controller. Controller design has come a long way since the old Atari joysticks or uncomfortable NES gamepads. I have used Sony's Dual Shock 3, Nintendo's Wii U Pro controller, Xbox 360 controller and Xbox One controller. They are all fantastic. But I must say I always liked the 360 controller the best. The Xbox One controller is simply an improvement upon that one. The only downside to the 360 controller was the mediocre D-pad, which has definitely experienced a massive improvement in the XBO update. They also moved the guide/dashboard button higher, which I like since I used to accidentally hit that when I meant to hit Start/Back. I even like how they redesigned the battery to go inside the controller. It takes slightly longer to swap a battery out, but since I use the USB cable to charge instead of swapping batteries (no Quick Charge Kit yet exists for the One like the 360 has), that doesn't matter at this point. The only thing I don't like is renaming the Start and Back buttons. \"Press Menu\" sounds way less cool than \"Press Start\" you're used to on any game's splash screen.\n\n+ Noise levels and cooling/reliability. Anyone who had a launch Xbox 360 or launch PlayStation 3 (I have both) knows what I'm talking about. Those things were LOUD. Distractingly loud. Even over my high-end surround speakers. The Xbox One's internal fan is very large compared to the launch 360 (google photos if its internals). Large fans can move more air and are not as loud as small fans. This also helps with its reliability, as the Xbox 360's biggest launch issues were overheating problems. Microsoft learned from this and I guarantee that will not be an issue here. I wanted to make sure of this, so I have literally had my Xbox One powered on almost 24 hours a day for the last week since launch day. This is because if it's going to overheat, I want to know now rather than down the line after the warranty is up. And I'm killing two birds with one stone because Killer Instinct has some goals related to how long you are in practice mode, so I leave it idling in practice mode while at work. Yeah, call me crazy. But anyway, so far, it has handled being constantly on for days at a time with not a single issue.\n\n+ I obviously can't speak for everyone else, but my Xbox One console, disc drive, controller, and Kinect, all function flawlessly and had absolutely no issues.\n\nWhat I'm not thrilled about:\n- Launch line-up. If you are on the fence about buying the console and you're not immediately sure what game(s) to even get for it, you could easily wait it out a while longer. Forza 5 and some of the multi-platform releases are pretty cool (like Need for Speed Rivals), but I'm not sure they're $60 cool. If you are buying the Xbox One now, you're doing it for the novelty of being among the first to have a cutting-edge system. This is true with the PS4 as well. Anybody who swears by any of the launch game is just a fanboy drone. There are a handful of *pretty good* games for both systems, but I see them as more of $30-40 titles. Honestly, I've enjoyed the downloadable Xbox One games the most, such as Killer Instinct, or the free Kinect Sports trial. A big disappointment is that digital versions of full retail games (like Call of Duty Ghosts) cost MSRP. Until Microsoft shares some of the cost reduction from going all-digital (no marketing, manufacturing, shipping, middle-man retailers, etc), I will ALWAYS buy my games in the form of the retail disc version. A $60 retail game should be $40-50 tops from the Xbox Live Store. It's so backwards that all the retail games are a flat $60 at all times via the Xbox Store, when already Amazon has had various sales that have at some point put them at $39 (Lego Marvel Superheroes) to $49 (almost every launch game). Have some digital sales and permanent price drops and I might actually buy some of them!\n\n- No backwards compatibility. This would have been an even more important feature now than it was on the Xbox 360. We've now had eight years to build up a game library on our Xbox 360s. Mine is quite large. Not being able to use that collection as a buffer between Xbox One launch, and when all the great XBO exclusives hit, is very disappointing. The original Xbox only had four years to amass its game library, and since it was the first of Microsoft's consoles, there were far less owners with far less games than now exists with the Xbox 360. A lot of the same sentiments apply to the PlayStation 4. Both consoles could have benefited greatly from a backwards compatibility feature, since neither of their game libraries will be very expansive for at least a year or so. It's also disappointing that I need to keep both consoles connected to my TV. When I bought my Wii U (and PS3, Xbox 360, PS2, Wii), I could give a nostalgic farewell to my Wii (and PS2, Xbox, PS1, GameCube) and disconnect them from my AV setup entirely, while still playing all my games.\n\n- USB Ports. All three versions of the Xbox 360, including the launch version, had 2 USB ports in the front of the console. My 360 S also has 3 in the back. I like never running out of USB ports. But the Xbox One has zero USB ports in the front, and only one on the side. So my Play and Charge cable has to plug into the side of the Xbox, meaning the cable can't reach as far, and someone tripping over the cable is more likely to result in damage to the console and/or cable. I also can't comfortably connect two controllers at once since one would have to be connected to the back. I'm also disappointed that external storage via USB isn't supported at launch, though it sounds like that is coming later on. But even when that feature is added, what if I want to charge a controller while also connecting a flash drive with some video files on them? I'd have to use the back ports, which I think should only ever be used for semi-permanent devices, like connecting a very large external hard drive. But those back USB ports may have to be used a lot more often than I'd like. Perhaps in 4 or so years, an Xbox One redesign will bring back more and better-placed USB ports.\n\n- No 3D Blu-ray support. Even last-generation had this feature on the PS3. The PS4 and Xbox One *both* don't support these. Why the step backwards?\n\nWhat I'm neutral about:\n* The console's physical design: It actually looks very nice to me. But it does have a small amount of boring-ness to it. It's just a big black box, basically. The key will be to keep the glossy part free of scratches and dust. Glossy consoles are notorious for aging much worse than matte consoles. It's also quite a bit bigger than the Xbox 360 redesigns (but on par with the launch Xbox &amp; Xbox 360 sizes). But I do have to say, I am very glad they are taking precautions to avoid the overheating issues of the launch 360s. The giant cooling heatsink/fan inside, and ample ventilation room inside this ominous monolith, will make it much more reliable and less susceptible to failure; an acceptable trade-off in my mind. I'm sure down the line there will be a smaller version of it. But I didn't want to wait 3-4 years to get it.\n\nThe bottom line is this: It's a great console with great potential, but as with most launch consoles, the games just aren't quite there to back it up, YET. If you are on the fence over the console because of the 360's launch reliability, I would honestly not let that hold you back on this one since Microsoft learned a very painful &amp; expensive lesson from that, and designed a much more reliable console this time around. But if you are waiting because you're unsure of the game library, you are probably justified in continuing to wait. I honestly just got it because I knew for sure I would eventually get it anyway when Halo 5 comes out. But it the price is holding you back, you may have to wait YEARS for this to become affordable. So if you are okay waiting that long, great. But otherwise you might as well get it now so you can actually use it while you wait for the game library to improve. Chances are, there won't be any price cuts on it for at least a couple years, and the price cuts aren't usually anything significant until around 4-5 years after launch. So if you have the patience (I didn't), definitely wait. But since I am 98.4% sure the price will still be $499 when Halo 5 comes out, I figured I may as well get it now along with the extra pre-order perks.\n\nA solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",

So, if you're running a movie and try to make it pause, you have to wait until the movie soundtrack is quiet. If there's any noise, the console can't differentiate between you and the sounds of the movie or game. I have a huge number of games for the 360 that won't work on this console, and there's a definite lack of RPG games available for this console.",

But I have a personal cloud so I'm storing most things off the computer. My music takes the most space.\n\nI just like it a lot!",

        "comment": "Comparing XBox One to PS4 is comparing apples to oranges, so there's no point in doing so. They're different systems that do different things.\n\nXBox One aims to integrate all of the entertainment you consume in the house into one device. It plays great games like the PS4, but also controls your Cable/Satellite TV and leverages the stable of apps that Microsoft has invested in, such as Skype for video calls to friends and family. The split-screen snapping of TV, game, web browser, Skype, NFL app and others is a great feature.\n\nMicrosoft aims very high in their goals for this system. Like the last system, it's built in a way to constantly evolve - the XBox One you use today will be different and better next year, the year after, and on and on, because it's designed for every part of it's software and functionality to be expanded upon and regularly updated.\n\nBottom line: it's cutting-edge in what it tries to do in bringing together apps, web browsing, TV and gaming. Like most cutting-edge products, it has its rough edges, but the ceiling of its potential is so high that it's hard to see. Impressive technology.",

That being said, Microsoft better step their game up soon and allow this beast to play 3D blu rays. My 8 year old DLP TV died 2 days after getting my new xbone. I bought a 3D Samsung Smart TV, and love it. For some reason,neither Microsoft nor Sony saw the need to release their next gen consoles with 3D playback. Why? The PS3 has it, and the PS4 and Xbone are much more capable from a hardware standpoint, it's merely software! I refuse to spend another ~$100 to get another peripheral. Also, I had my cable box hooked up through the xbox, but the surround sound was horrible, so it's back to the old setup.",

I may feel different later with some updates or better games. I also own a PS4 and find myself playing that more now, it looks better and the playstation network has free games to download. Kind of funny but I originally bought a PS3 and then switched to Xbox 360 because I liked it better and now I am switching back to playstation. I am not totally ruling out the Xbox One, it has potential, I am just not that impressed right now especially for the price.",

        "comment": "I've been using the XBOX since introduction, always wind up owning both major systems and favor online play which typically pushes me towards XBOX a little bit more as I simply favor XBL over PSN. With this launch I was terribly disappointed by the lack of Quality Control and was one of those users impacted by the optical drive issue, but once remediated was extremely satisfied. I will say MS did right by me eventually with games and XBL once I worked through my issues with customer service.\n\nOne of those games was Dead Rising 3 which truly showcases the innovative approach MS is taking with it's alternative interfaces to gaming, smart glass and Kinect are so tightly integrated to this experience that it truly opened my eyes to what is possible on the XB1 if the developers only take the time to do so. Worthwhile checking out as your smart device with smart glass app becomes an extension of the in-game phone of the character with maps, items, exclusive side quests, and even freaking air strikes being controlled via it. Kinect is used for a more immersive style of play and often I find myself playing in dead silence so as to not lure zombies to me when running low on health. READ: I whisper to those next to be to be quiet as they are luring the zombies to me when they are loud!\n\nTo me, NG gaming isn't just about speeds and feeds as 4K/8K are still a ways away and even then a cruddy game in higher res is just a sharper piece of crud. The XB1 has done an excellent job of integrating the Kinect and ensuring to developers that all users will have it and develop to it unlike that of the move. This makes me believe that the higher probability lie with XB1 to introduce more \"interesting\" and immersive games certainly I believe that after having had a dose of it within DR3. This isn't to say the other games aren't great but TBH those titles on both systems are just sharper and smoother FPS performing titles, even Forza 5 which is a fantastic racer in it's own right but lacks that same thrill as DR3 because of it's traditional approach. They tried to use Kinect in it, but it's accuracy and usability is in question for me.\n\nAll in all, I am extremely happy with the XB1 and would recommend it as a purchase again, still getting used to it being the hub of my living room and have chosen to give it some time as I see where MS is going with it and like what I see them trying to accomplish.",

Control of other devices works through the Kinect device (mine broke after three weeks). The options for configuring that control are very limited at this time. It won't do anything with a Tivo Mini, but controlled the awful cable company box well. I was hoping for a Logitech Harmony on streroids and got the equivalent of the universal remotes you see at drug store registers instead.",

Hooked up through your cable box is very impressive but at the same time can be annoying after a while. I highly recommend the X1. Games that are on both X1 and 360 do NOT have a huge graphics upgrade. Forza 5 is visually stunning however!",

I'm sure there will be software updates that will help this console reach it's full potential.",

In theory it sounded great to control all your stuff from one box with voice commands but it did not work for me. Usually I live by the philosophy \"If it's too good to be true, it probably is\" and this proves true with my experience. I have an electronic engineering background and I really did give it a fair try. I moved and calibrated the Kinect sensor in many different locations around my living room for hours. In the end I was just plain frustrated and felt stupid yelling XBOX ON with nothing but a dead box looking back at me. If you are looking for the next generation gaming system then I'm sure the Xbox One is the next best thing, but if your an occasional gamer and want it for controlling your living room by voice, look else where.",

The voice command makes everything nice. I don't understand why all the games have to be \"installed\" on the unit but that's why I play them, not make them. I will not be buying anything to play online i.e. Xbox Gold or live or whatever you wanna call it. Take note from PlayStation on this. If it wasn't for getting this unit for \"free\" I would've never shelled out the $499 they are asking for plus extra for the games and what-not. With that being said, not bad at all.",

The XBOX One needs to be on every minute you are watching TV if you choose to take advantage of the TV features. I used to watch TV to give my 360 a break and believe taking care of it in this manner contributed to its longevity. Early 360 adopters will recall overheating was an issue leading to a \"red ring of death.\" This system has EIGHT processors and runs so hot, I know it is consuming plenty of power. You have the option not to take advantage of the ability to route/control your TV with the unit. I wanted to like/use the interactive features with my TV, but do not like another very hot entertainment appliance running every minute my TV is on and will probably re-route my TV around the XBOX One.",

As far as the interface goes a few things have changed when compared to the 360 but once you get it figured out things aren't so bad. I do like that you can pin things to your first screen to make them quick to access, plus your most recently used apps/games are on the main home screen along the bottom.\n\nAt this point my biggest complain is the party system. Unless you do things just right the party won't work. Between having a 30 second window for accepting a party invitation to sometimes the chat just not working.... There have been times that my group has spent as much time making the party work as we did actually gaming. Once things get going at least the party sticks together.\n\nThe potential is there and once Titanfall comes out I think things are going to be incredibly amazing.",

There are just a few 360 games that I wanted to try and come to find out I can't. :-(",

        "comment": "I'm not one to be obsessed with anything, but man can this thing do it all. I find myself using my Xbox one for everything because that is what it was built for. I play video games with great graphics, watch TV (Football usually) even while playing a game, and using Xbox fitness to get in shape while having fun. That's generally speaking; now let\u2019s get into more detail.\n\n[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5\n\n[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5\n\n[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out. 4.7/5\n\n[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about. The Bumpers on the controller are a little bit annoying. They take some getting used to because they are positioned slightly differently and make a very loud and annoying sound. The thumbsticks are smaller which is somewhat better and also have the edges a little tighter which keeps it from tearing like it did on my 360 controller. The positioning of the home button is much better in that it doesn't get in the way of the buttons. When my Dad plays, he might hit the center of the 360 button in the middle of the game, but this controller helps avoid that from happening. Overall it is similar to the 360 controller and I believe it is easy to get use to the new layout within a day or two. 4.6/5\n\n[Design] Now this is an ugly Xbox, but that was kind of expected now wasn't it. The upside to this is that we will not have to go through the horrible red ring of death. It is capable of keeping cool and will not overheat even if on for 24 hours straight for every day, I would know. I'm sure within 2 or 3 years we will have a redesigned Xbox that is smaller, just like how the Xbox slim was released. Another upside is that the Xbox is very quiet which is quite surprising given the size and consumption of it. But until then, just be content with the fact that there is no more red ring. 3.5/5 (The 3.5 is mostly due to the upsides)\n\n[Xbox, Record That] Well the Xbox is constantly recording the last 5 minutes of gameplay so you can easily record anything, either automatically or with a voice command. Unfortunately I have been having trouble with the voice command so I have been stuck having to do it manually. Sharing videos with friends is very easy thanks to this. Hopefully people will reduce the uploads of there uninteresting videos and keep it restricted to only the ones worth watching. 3.9/5\n\n[Movies] Finally a blu-ray player, I have been wanting this for many years. Although I already had one in my living room, I could really use one in my basement. Sometimes you just want to watch a movie by yourself without being disturbed or by disturbing others, this is why this came in handy. Now that I get almost all my movies either streaming or Blu-ray, the Xbox is my number 1 movie player. It is true that you have to download an app to play the blu-ray, but it's free and easy. 5/5\n\n[Kinect] Well, well, well, so you add a Kinect Microsoft and you bump up the cost 100 bucks more than the PS4?... NO PROBLEM! I am not disappointed at all. The Kinect is amazing; 10 times better than the old kinect. I can say anything and the kinect will do it with ease. Also, almost all games have at least some kinect functionality. Battlefield lets you turn your head in order to turn your head in battlefield when in a vehicle which is really cool. FIFA allows subs to be made just by saying it which is also cool. As time goes on, I feel that the kinect will be more and more useful in these games. In the end, this is a great addition to the Xbox. 4.6/5\n\n[Overall] With everything the Xbox has to offer, there is no other thing I would rather have. I give it a 4.46/5 for now, but I think I will rank it higher as time goes by. It has been great for everything, mainly gaming with revolutionary graphics. And remember, it can only get better from here.",

        "comment": "I am gamer and prefer Microsoft over Sony and needless to say I was completely disappointed with this new console. I got it 2 days ago and am returning it because it is pretty much the same as the 360 but a few new looks and picture quality is a little better. My first and biggest disappointment is the controller and headset. When I opened it and took it out I thought it was fake. The controller is a little bigger then the 360 and the sticks are smaller on the new controller. I thought if I pressed too hard on the controller I would break it because it felt so cheap IMO. The D pad looks like it shouldn't even be on there and the head set hookup looks like a chat pad and is really bulky. Another thing is I couldn't hook up an old set of Turtles to the new controller and I don't want to shell out another $100 when mine work perfectly fine. I am not of fan of the new controller at all and hope that they come out with a new one that closer resembles the 360 controller.\n\nThe other thing I was disappointed in was the Kinect. It did not respond to my commands like I saw when they had the reveal of the xbox one. I told it multiple commands and it didn't even get close to what I was saying, it was very frustrating. I don't know if the Kinect needs to be in a super large room to work better but the room it was in was pretty decent sized. The face recognizing is good though. The hand controls were terrible as well and took multiple tries to do anything. And lastly and most disappointing was the supposedly seamless switch from game to TV and back. I switched from a movie to live TV and back to a movie and one, it wasn't as fast as shown in the reveal and two, it restarted the movie?!?! Maybe I am wrong but I thought it was supposed to go back to where it left off and be pretty much an instant change but it wasn't and took awhile to even recognize my voice.\n\nThe one good thing is the picture quality on the blu ray player. I can not complain about that but I don't want to pay $500 for a blu ray player. So I will be taking it back and will wait for it to work out the kinks or drop drastically in price before I even think about buying this again. And I have even thought about going to PS4 and forgetting this waste of a system. So all in all it is not worth $500 at all and am perfectly happy with my 360 and a blu ray player. The only way I would recommend this to someone is if they had $500 to blow and like to have the latest in gaming consoles because that's honestly all it is, is something to say you have.\n\nAs for you Microsoft I am disappointed you would release such an average system at that price.",

I am a Samsung android phone user, so not an Apple-all-the-way guy, but they do make great machines and this one is fast and easy to navigate once you get the hang of the touchpad which took a couple of days since I was so accustomed to a mouse.

The ability to 'snap' and do two things at once is incredible and something that will take some getting used to since I've never been able to do that with a console before. The only things that I'm not thrilled about yet are the lack of launch titles. (To be fair though there are a lot of games coming out soon that I'm looking forward to AND every time a new console comes out, I'm not happy with the quality or the quantity of launch titles.) Overall it's a fantastic system and I'm sure as the games catch up with the console, the Xbox one will surely prove itself superior to the PS4.",

I am excited for Titanfall, and hopefully even more exclusive content MIcrosoft has planned for us!\n\nPleasant surprises: Premium Skype experience with 1080p kinect camera, Internet surfing on tv is finally fun, good amount of free entertainment apps at Day 1, voice control is amazing when it works right\n\nCould be improved: Better connectivity with all other Win 8 products - Sony Vita can play PS4 games. Why can't I stream my Xbox One gameplay to a Win 8 tablet or phone? How about displaying my tablet/phone content on my big screen tv through my Xbox One?",

I'm disappointed that it is not backward-compatible with games for the 360, but the games that are designed specifically for the One are truly amazing, from a graphical standpoint. I used to use my 360 as a Media Center Extender for my HTPC, however, the One does not have this functionality. Rather, it uses an HDMI-passthrough that allows you to display video from your cable box or HDMI cable box. You can use your voice to turn everything in your system on or off and even change channels. It's truly amazing. I do wish that there were more apps available at launch. One of the most glaring omissions is the lack of an Xfinity On-Demand app like on the 360. The Verizon FiOS app just became available, so I remain hopeful that the Xfinity app isn't far behind.",

After about a month though our cable box stopped working when it was connected through the xbox, the picture kept disappearing. That's the only issue we've had so far.\n\nLove the voice commands, even our 7 year old can control it easily. It's a great buy!",

        "comment": "As far as the Maverick OS experience goes, this laptop is probably at the top for just about anyone's needs except gamers/game developers.\n\nSince I was already emptying my wallet for this, I decided to upgrade the processor to an i7 and get the 8 gigs of ram. While I can't say I've noticed the processor making a difference, the 8 gigs of ram has certainly come in handy for my multitasking.\n\nI've primarily been a Microsoft guy my whole life, and I don't plan on changing that even after this purchase. However, hardware aside, the Maverick OS does make the mundane tasks on a computer fun and relatively easy. Unfortunately, Apple decided it was worth hundreds of extra dollars, and that irritates me.\n\nThe difference is the Haswell processor. Whatever Intel did with their 4th generation i-core processors - it works. The power management is solid. Especially on the less-taxing Maverick OS. You can expect as much battery life as an iPad in some situations.\n\nThe design of the Macbook Air becomes a perfect bow on top of a nice package. I am definitely one that believes the aesthetics of a machine can make all the difference in the world when it comes to your experience. I routinely wield this laptop one handed with ease. I barely feel it in my bag.\n\nAlso, the metal casing is one that many companies that produce Windows laptops should take note of. I understand that plastic is cheaper, but I feel much more secure using the Macbook Air all day because of its sturdiness.\n\nI can't leave out the track pad either. While this may seem like a minor detail, it truly is unrivaled. Browsing through anything on the computer is incredibly easy with the pad. It has perfect positioning, and great responsiveness. All of the motions work without err as far as my experience has reached.\n\nDownsides:\n\nNow, there are a couple notable kickers here. First, the laptop costs a fortune. I believe I paid close to 1400 dollars for mine. This is the point where you have to really ask yourself, is this worth it? For many, it is. This Macbook Air will certainly last you for quite awhile. But if you really aren't sold or too concerned with the fanciness of a machine, you really should look far away from Apple products.\n\nSecond, while you can get Office, you can only get the 2011 version. Microsoft does this on purpose. Microsoft and Apple are not friends. And as such, you can expect that there will be some discrepancies in cross-platform support for some applications. Don't think you can do everything on a Macbook that you can on a Windows laptop...I assure you that you can't. Even so, most people probably won't notice, and that's important to notice. Apple may have come out with alternatives to the things they're lacking, but the truth is the standard is Microsoft for most professional software.\n\nSummary:\n\nAll of that being said, you probably aren't going to buy a Mac for its Microsoft support. You definitely won't buy it for the deal value. For what this laptop accomplishes, it's at the top in my book. You can run just about everything the majority of people need to run, and it does it all with extraordinary battery life and an attractive interface. That's why you buy this laptop.\n\nNOTE: I think in retrospect, I would've gone with the 11 inch version. It kind of maximizes the portability aspects that the MacAir is good for. Also saves you a little cash.\n\nNOTE 2: Don't listen to these people who worry about storage. 128GB is plenty of on-board storage currently, and if you truly need more you can save a lot of money just by grabbing flash drives or using the cloud.\n\nNOTE 3: The whole thunderbolt business is absurd. You have to buy seemingly millions of adapters to plug this machine into anything. Just give me an HDMI port.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "This is easily the best laptop that I have ever owned. I spent months trying out various PC laptops and none of them could deliver what I was looking for.\n\nUltimately, I just decided to go ahead and spend the money and buy a Macbook Air. I sprung for the 13\" as it was on sale at the time. Best decision I could have made. While more expensive, this computer is light (~2 lbs), fast, reliable (have had no lock ups in the time that i have had it - unlike some of the other laptops I tried), and the battery life is amazing. I can get up to 15hrs of battery life depending on what I am doing! Add to that the great chiclet-style keyboard, the best laptop trackpad out there, backlighting on the keyboard, and a great/bright display. It is worth the price of admission in my opinion.\n\nOSX may not be for everyone. I've used it in the past and find it intuitive. It also helps that there are OSX versions of Office, and knowing that Windows could even run on this if need be. On top of that, I use Citrix Web Access for work, and it actually runs more reliably through Safari on my MacBook than it does on the other PCs we have around the house. I also consider myself a photography enthusiast, and to me there are so many more options for various photography editing applications on Mac (whether it be an app, or a full-fledged program).\n\nI would say this is a perfect laptop for someone who wants a solid, reliable, portable, easy to use laptop. Yes, it is a little more expensive than a comparable PC laptop, but you are also getting a more stable OS and the support that Apple throws behind their products.",

TV sometimes simply doesn't work when connected through the xbox one system. Read online about issues microsoft is having. I reset my xbox (held down power for 8-10 seconds) and it fixed it for now. Also, I played a ghosts game and the mic didnt work and didn't pick up other people's microphones either. Again, after a reset it worked again.\n\nMicrosoft still has some kinks to work out on the system, but it's amazing overall!",

No, the OneGuide is not super helpful or all that intuitive. Mastering all xbox one's new controls takes quite a bit of time. But you can definitely see the potential down the road on just how cool it could become in all departments. Major flaw is definitely the lack of games. Nothing out that's all that special right now but that will change soon I'm sure. Yes I would recommend it!",

Overall love this console I think I made a good choice buying it! :) if you have cable but not the cable box then there's no point of the channel feature for you :)",

While it has significant potential and in the coming months will undoubtedly be the industry leading console with the best tech., at launch it did not show this. There are some kinks to fix, like with the Kinect verbal commands. All of which will be fixed in time with use and updates.\n\nIn simple terms, the hardware is most certainly there and will meet expectations. However, the launch software will take time to catch up. This was shown with Battlefield 4, a launch title for the console. It has taken months for the game to catch up and be a stable game on this platform. This being said, the ability to have head tracking and verbal commands is only the beginning. As game developers and software updates progress, the true ability of the Xbox One and Kinect will be discovered.\n\nBe patient with the software, understand the significance of the hardware, and get your hands on this must own console at your leisure.",

The blue ray player wont even play 3D movies, and the Xbox music should really be a lot better if Microsoft is expecting ppl to pay for it...\nIf you're an Xbox person you'll prob like it, but if you're a PS person, stick to what you know, no need to convert.",

For whatever reason it doesn't work. You must use either internet explorer or firefox browsers to open and then verify your account that way. E-mail is the only way to verify. That doesn't make since to me. When I called xbox customer support ( one hour hold time ) about the problem their reply was... we have no way to over ride the system. WHAT??? Your Microsoft for Pete's sake!! You can't over ride, you can't verify by phone, or text. Nothing but e-mail. Anyway, that is the only complaint I have.\nThe system itself is great! Very realistic and my son LOVES it, which is all that really matters!",

Long waits every time I turn on my computer on or wake it up from sleep is a thing of the past. The battery life is just fabulous ~10 hours even when I'm streaming series from netflix. In regards to the performance, the computer is very fast and it never freezes. Even though this is the first apple computer I own (I've been hesitant for a longng time to transition from PCs to macs) it has been a lot easier than anticipated precisely because the operating system is so intuitive.",

        "comment": "I have been an Xbox fan since the beginning and just like the 360 launch, my wife was out there trying to score a One for me for Christmas. Turns out she was able to and a nice surprise to open her up Christmas morning.\n\nSetup was a little on the difficult side. I don't mean figuring out how to set it up, that was easy, I mean getting everything to work correctly. It took some doing to get my X1 passing through the One. Also, I have calibrated and re-calibrated my Kinect several times. It is working much better but still sometimes won't sign me in or doesn't hear my commands. Meanwhile, my wife and son were in the kitchen this morning and said \"juice box\" and the One came to life waiting for a command? It would be nice if it was that sensitive when I spoke to it.\n\nThe launch line up is light yes, but so is every launch lineup. Still, Ryse: Son of Rome looks and plays great. Assassins's Creed: Black Flag, even though a port, looks and plays beautifully.\n\nThe OS is just great, intuitive and much better than the 360. Basically it is the Windows 8 shell wrapped around Xbox OS. Cannot complain at all. It has everything I want and use right on my main screen. It really did take over my living room. I have everything controlled by the One. Powers up all my gear and then down at the end of the night with ease.\n\nJust to even out my review, I will say one bad thing. I have had to hard boot it twice since Christmas. It seems the X1 got frozen in the main window. I couldn't get it to respond without a cold boot. Something to keep an eye on but I also have the extended warranty.\n\nSo that's it. This is leaps and bounds ahead of the 360 in every single conceivable way. Graphics, hardware capability, software improvements. I cannot stress enough just how great of a system this is.",

This means that if you connect the system as they recommend, you will need to have the XBOX on just to watch TV. That is not convenient for my wife who doesn't care about the XBOX or for when I just want to easily turn on the TV and watch. Instead I have to go through the process of turning on the XBOX and then telling it to watch TV. Also, there aren't many games available for it right now but I know that will improve.",

You have to really look for the improvements in graphics. I do like using the NFL app and watching football games and seeing my fantasy stats updated in real time. The NFL app is also good if you want to see all of the coverage of your favorite team, but don't want to sit and watch all of the different shows on the NFL channel. I have played only Madden 25 on the system so far. I can see the improvements in the graphics in this game. Overall, if you are a video game junkie (I am) then go ahead and purchase the system. However, if you are trying to decide between the two new systems or price is an issue, then I would wait until later to get this system.",

I have several friends who have MacBooks and while they have the Pros, I chose the Air because of the lightness and the fact that I don't use it beyond simple word processing and research and studies. Had I been a heavy duty game player or something like that I would probably have gone with the Pro.\nThe one thing that I do not like about the Air is that it only has two USB ports which limits what you can use at one time. If I am working with the external CD/ROM-DVD drive then I loose a USB port, which limits what I can do. I am preparing to do a lot of traveling and teaching and I am hoping that this does not become a major problem. So far I have found work arounds. Overall, however, I really like my Air.",

        "comment": "First Xbox One the Gpu failed, red dots and lines while gaming. Only six cores are assigned for gaming while two are for backround processes. 768 steam units while 128 are locked due to software. While the xbox one has gcn2.0 vs ps4 which has gcn1.0 gpu units its not a real advantage just a more efficient design. Not twice as effective which people seem to think it is, more like 10-23% better with a driver support which there is no support for it at this time. Would be a better idea to unlock all the gpu steam units and up the gpu to 900mhz or even just unlock them and run at the standard 853mhz. Its in dire need of software fixes. While the party chat mode and jumping in a friends game was great in the Xbox 360 its a hassle in the Xbox One. You think it would have improved from that but its more or less like the Xbox 360 was at lanuch. To sum it up, its not worth the 500.00 price tag. Even the main board pcb has some cheap diode's and coils that we used, these types were used one the Xbox 360 and after time leak or explode. Disappointing compared to the Ps4 layout while uses all quality components. Also the hard drive is only 500gb, 320gb reserved for games, its not replaceable, you would have to purchase an external hard drive. Supports usb 3.0 hard drives. Installing a portion of a game in mandatory to play it, takes a good 30min too 2hrs and multiplayer does not work until its installed. Kct is over hyped, and not worth it imo.No support for 1080i just 1080p, 720p and 480p. One plus is that is quite, even while gaming. Microsoft plans on offloading more to the cloud servers in a year or two and more in the future so gaming will be more or streaming based. While the bandwidth won't be supported by most residents for 10yrs plus which means this is a concept ahead of its time. Last thing is while the Xbox 360 and PS3 were ahead of its time, the newer Xbox One is a mere low entry level system and PS4 is closer to mid range. While microsoft swears by esram its much more of a hassle to program for vs a unified memory pool which is used on newer apu's by amd and the PS4.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "The Xbox One is admittedly the more expensive of the two major entries into this generation's console wars. Let's be honest. PS4 is $100 cheaper. But what are you getting for that $100? The Kinect: This edition's Kinect plays better it shorter spaces (a totally deal stopper for me before) and voice use is so much better than before. Whereas before I'd often simply use the controller to do simple system navigation, now I can honestly use voice to navigate the tiles and move through the interface.\n\nThe best and ... not so great experience is live TV (in my case cable) integration with the XBOX. In my case, the cable comes from the wall, directly to the Xbox one, Xbox One into the TV. So how does it work? The TV comes on when you say \"Xbox On (for the Xbox), Xbox Watch TV (to bring up the TV).\" Channel navigation can be ordered up by voice, but finding your HD channels may be a problem. Using the \"Xbox Select\" command can highlight the selections you can make, but if you have some 500+ channels, remembering names can be a little bit of a chore.\n\nYes, that's my complaint (had to make one). Remember folks, this is Microsoft. They may not get it right the first time, but they'll iterate until they do. It is how software folks think. I went with the XBOX because of that thinking as PS4 / Sony may not have that drive to iterate and get better... admittedly I don't have direct experience with that however.\n\nBut back to that $100 difference, remember, the games will likely be cross platform, but what else are you doing with that console. At my house? It gets used for the various video services, fitness classes and Xbox One only iterates on that and makes it better. So would I recommend it? Yes I would. YMMV.",

The lag between the video an sound grows to ridiculous lengths - I've witnessed 2-3 seconds! I've seen old dubbed kung-fu movies that sync up better than the Xbox One.

Still early because the XBOX Live Apps needs to be refined and more additions need to be added. I was debating for the longest whether to get a PS4 or XBOX One and i'm so happy I went with the XBOX. The only thing that's not great if most of my friends and co workers decided to get the PS4 so its hard to not be able to come into work or hang out and not be able to talk smack about playing them online. Since having the XBOX One I only had one problem and that was that my Kinect just stopped working and displayed a \"Kinect Unplugged\" Message in the top right corner of the screen even though it was connected and also multiple attempts at reseating the connector that connects to the console. I just went on the XBOX Support Website and with no hassles or anything I got a new one in five days and sent the broken one in. Also I noticed that my warranty on the new KInect was extended so that's pretty cool. So over all I'm a happy XBOX One owner.",

The new smart glass app works very well when applied but is in no way necessary, in case you lack a smart phone. The graphics, as one might expect, are absolutely stunning. The TV feature is awesome and very convenient. Once a game gets started, there's practily no load time.",

I do love resogun and the fact that ps4 has a variety of free to play games mostly available to ps + members. I found xbox one games more enjoyable as of launch. The kinnect is amazing i cant wait to see future updates on the xbox. The controller is also amazing, very high quality although i do prefer the grip like texture feel that the ps4 has better, but none the less i am very impressed with the x1 controller. This is a great console cant wait for future updates",

        "comment": "With this product it is clear that Microsoft had a different focus for this new generation of gaming consoles. The Xbox One in my opinion is an overall great family entertainment system with Netflix coming standard on every console and it's ability to play blu-ray movies and discs. Gaming graphics wise the graphics the Xbox One produces are very good, but side-by-side to the PS4, the PS4 is noticeably better. If graphics are a big part of your gaming experience then go with the PS4. What I like most about the Xbox One is the clean dashboard and the new Kinect integration. I know this review is pretty long winded but overall I think the One is a great system for the family offering loads of entertainment for anyone to enjoy",

At first I thought the Mac would be overpriced for my purposes but its proven to be well worth the money, particularly since I got it on sale during Black Friday. The only real problem I have with the Mac is that I have to learn new shortcuts and remembering whether to use the control, option or command button is confusing.

Luckily I have enough HDMI's and room to keep both systems hooked up. The XBox One seems to have a lot of potential, BUT trying to get it to take a DVD/Game in can be trying. I don't know if this is a defective unit or a design flaw so there are some concerns. The new kinect is awesome but it's still glitchy with hand and voice commands.

        "comment": "To me this system seemed rushed. The interface seems simple and boring, Granted it's still early to tell the overall grade for the system since it just came out not long ago and because they will have plenty of updates to the interface and abilities. One thing I don't care for which is advertised a lot is the snap function. It's not that neat and only hinders the experience. Also if you want to have music playing you have to have it in snap mode which takes up a fourth of the screen and you also have to go through Microsoft's music store and spend your hard earned cash. On the 360 you could plug in your ipod or even rip cd's onto the hard drive and play music in the background. It even replaced the game's music with the sound effects still there. If you wanted to change the song you would just press the middle button and you could pause, mute, change the song, etc. This with many other features have been stripped for the X Box One and I have no clue as to why. Graphics are a slight upgrade and it will only get better I'm sure. One cool thing is how you can seamlessly switch between all your apps and pick right up where you left off in your game. Usually with no hiccups. ALSO calibrate your kinect, pronounce every word perfectly and talk loud and clearly!!! lol",

        "comment": "I got this MacBook Air mostly for school use. It has a great display and awesome speaker system. It also has a great battery life. However, if you are a gamer, this is NOT for you! The battery does not stand up to lots of game playing. An hour of heavy game play can leave it very hot and the battery almost completely drained. The aluminum body is very great. It offers protection that a plastic one can't offer. The hinge is very sensitive, however. If a plastic case is put on it, it will flop over easily because its so loose. However, without the case it works just fine. One other downside to the MacBook Air is how expensive it is and the fact that it doesnt have very much memory. It can be bought with more, but that makes it even MORE expensive!!! But still, overall, I really enjoy this MacBook Air and would recommend it for everyone but gamers.",

Now that the price shock has ended we are happy it reduced the amount of gadgets, blue ray player, cords, laptop, we kept near the tv. We love it! Now we can enjoy switching between entertainment systems effortlessly and quickly. It has caused us to spend more time together watching television, netflicks, games. However the down side is there are not a lot of games available yet. That will change soon. I would recommend it for a family with young teenagers.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I ended up getting both the PS4 and Xbox One, and I have to say that overall they have a lot of similarities. The big difference, in my opinion, is that the Xbox One is more of an Entertainment Center and the PS4 is more of a Gaming Center. As far as gaming goes, I see a slight improvement in graphics, but overall the game play has not changed much other than adding voice commands through the kinect. This is a cool feature, and I love being able to shout out commands as I am running and gunning, but it is minimal, and wouldn't think twice if it was removed. Where the Xbox shines is how it interfaces with your TV. I love being able to switch quickly between my Xbox and TV without effort. Being able to pull up Amazon Prime, Netflix, or HuluPlus vocally without having to switch between multiple devices feels like I am in the future. I used to use my PS for watching blurays, but I have switched to using my Xbox so I do not have to switch between TV video inputs. Also, I'm someone that gets distracted easily and will pause a movie during the boring parts and do something else or watch something else and come back, so this fits perfectly for me. I switch to something else, and when I get bored with that, I switch back. As far as the PS4, that is more of a gaming console. When I play a game on the PS4, the graphics are stunning and easy to contrast to last gen. With the needed improvement to its controller to align more to Xbox's design, I do not feel as hampered playing FPSs. Also the PS controller has a speaker within the controller, so when I picked up an audiolog and heard it through my controller for the first time while hearing the game from my TV, it was an absolutely amazing experience. I can not wait for the next Dead Space iteration as I can only imagine how awesome the audio experience will be. So after about a month, I've fallen into a habit of gaming with my PS4, but since I'm a casual gamer, I end up spending majority of my time on my Xbox as I tend to relax most watching TV and movies. So depending on your preferences for entertainment and relaxation, either console is great, but if I could only select one option, I would prefer the Xbox over the PS as it aligns more to my personal preferences for entertainment.\nAs far as the controller using AA batteries, I know this has been a contested complaint between many users with a lot of people finding it a frivolous complaint. For me, with the money spent and the next gen advertising that went on, I expected the power source of my controller to be more akin to my smartphone than my flashlight. If Microsoft wants to make money off of add-on products, they should have followed Sony's lead and gave one short cord for multiple controllers and sell charging stations or additional charging cords separately.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "Let me start off by saying I have never owned a previous Xbox, my last gaming console was the Nintendo Wii and before that was the PS2. With that being said, WOW what a console! Things have really changed over the last eight years and before then (referring to the PS2)!\n\nI will start off with my only negative experience. SETUP WAS A PAIN! When I first plugged in my new Xbox One, it would not power up. I had to unplug the cord from the surge protector and the unit, waited about one minute then plugged it back in and it powered up! That should not have happened to begin with. Then I tried to connect it to my wireless network. It would not pick up either SSID that I was broadcasting (5ghz and 2.4ghz). I tried to manually configure it and that would not work. I verified everything was working on the network side and it was. All my other devices within a few feet were working just fine and had a strong signal. (Keep in mind I have a four year degree in Networking, I have multiple wireless routers configured to extend my range, etc... So it wasn't a networking issue) I could not reboot the Xbox One, so my only choice was to pull the power cord. I was worried to do this due to the device was trying to do the initial setup. I had no other choice, so I pulled the power cord and waited a minute (with my fingers crossed that it would boot back up properly). Well it did and then it found my wireless network, I was able to connect it to the network and move forward. Then it came to the mandatory update. I waited for a half hour and no progress was made on the update. I then verified my 15mbps download speed was still active and it was. I waited a little longer, just to be on the safe side. Finally after a total of 45 minutes and the update not starting the download, I did the only thing I could do. PULL THE POWER CORD AGAIN!!!! With my fingers crossed I waited another minute, plugged it back in and booted up the Xbox One. It did pick up where it left off stating it needed to download and install the update. I clicked accept and instantly it started to download. Within a matter of minutes the download was complete and the update was being installed.\n\nSo after all this headache and well over 2 hours I had my new Xbox One up and running! This is my only complaint.\n\nNow, onto what I like about the console! The kinect is great for my little girl! She loves it and enjoys playing Zoo Tycoon on the Xbox One. The graphics are AWESOME! Call of Duty Ghosts looks and plays amazing, although I currently stink at online play.\n\nWhats just OK with the Xbox One? Well the TV integration to begin with. You must have the Xbox One on to watch TV. The console cannot be in standby mode or off to watch TV. To me that is not a true HDMI passthrough setup as Microsoft claims. This is annoying for people who visit (such as family) who want to go downstairs and watch TV, there is the extra step of turning on the Xbox One. I hope this gets fixed with a future update. I wish you didn't have to buy Xbox Live Gold just to use some of the features such as, Netflix or Amazon Video. For online gaming I can understand the requirement, but not for these third party applications. The voice and hand controls do not always work, but them seem to be OK. I'm sure this will get better over time with patches and updates. I also wish there was some sort of stand or mount for the Kinect! I had to purchase one for it to sit on top of my TV. Without it, the Kinect would not be in the recommended height range (2-6 feet off the floor).\n\nI would highly recommend this console to anyone looking to buy the current generation video game console or looking to upgrade! Now I wish my friends who have Xbox 360's would upgrade so we can play online against each other!",

        "comment": "As a piece of hardware I really like the xbox one, it has a great baseline of specs. I especially like that it reduces the amount of controllers I need by doing a pretty good job of being an all in one machine. It is now my bluray player and cable box, both work well. I do have gripes about the efficiency of the OS but I have to remind myself that this is what i should expect with the first generation of a new platform. It'll be a growth process but I really believe kinks with load times and usage of the RAM will work itself out over time. Overall I love this system.",

And i'm easily satisfied with how the graphics are.\nNegatives: once you buy a game for it, it has to be fully installed before you can play all of the game's features. In which the time it takes to download it, I think, depends on your internet connection.",

The guide button is not what you think, it brings you to the dashboard and that is where you can do things like go into a party etc, but it is a little more difficult to navigate than the 360 was. If they have a system update that makes the \"Home\" button function the same way it did on the 360 I would make this review 5 stars. A few other games would be ideal as well, those should be coming soon though! If there are any questions, feel free to comment on this review, I will be notified and will respond as soon as I can!",

        "comment": "I would recommend Xbox One to any big gamer. I think any big gamer should have the Wii U and Xbox One or PS4.\n\nThe Xbox One is a great system and has found a way to appeal to the masses. It works well most of the time and the games are very enjoyable The launch line up leaves a lot to be desired, like most launch games on a new system. A better future is coming for it though. It will be great to see Titanfall later this year and also Halo.\n\nXbox 360 owners will be pleased, but disappointed in what is lacking from the prior system.\n\nRyse: Son of Rome is Microsoft's almost hit it answer to God of War. Battlefield 4 and Call of Duty: Ghosts both deliver better graphics, but same gameplay. Dead Rising 3 is pretty much Grand Theft Auto with zombies. Killer Instinct is a reimagined version of the original, but does not touch new territory.\n\nI loved how the Xbox 360 had you press the middle button on the controller and you could see who was online, also how much battery left on your controller. All that has gone out the door with the weird new Windows 8 set up.\n\nThere are also many glitches within the system, although they happen 5% of the time. I've had games and apps suddenly close. Killer Instinct, I get out of matchmaking and the game is still looking for players somehow. Also, the system loads sometimes, kind of like a PC.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the system home screen and glitches are improved. I am looking forward to a game that puts the Kinect to good use like on the Xbox 360. Also, will be interesting to see how Microsoft decides to keep finding ways to make more money within games and apps.",

        "comment": "i'm a pretty big gamer so i was really excited when XBOX 360 started getting more into multimedia. When I heard the the XBOX ONE was going to be a multimedia \"hub\" I signed on right away. I got my XBOX ONE hooked it all up and..... played Killer Instinct, a 25 year old game. Don't get me wrong, I was really excited to play it again after all this time but it seemed sort of anti-climatic. there was little else to do on the XBOX ONE right out of the box. No XBOX live arcade. No demos. No video content except for the subscription apps like Netflix. I really lacks the sense of community that the XBOX 360 has gotten me used to.\n\nthe Kinect interface is good. seems more responsive than the 360. that said I still used and play my 360 a lot and having 2 Kinects seems like a waste. I would like a way to chain the 2 systems together.\n\nSo basically the XB1 is a good start. I'm excited to see what Microsoft will add to it. Hopefully there'll be a way to download XBL arcade games and 360 games eventually.",

The crazy part is that you still have to use the disk after you install the game. Outside of that its a great system and I am happy with my purchase. The Xbox one has the best lineup of exclusives and having the ability to change channels and watch movies with your voice its nice. This is the future.",

        "comment": "The Xbox One is a good gaming console. It's fast and sleek, but lacks key features that the Xbox 360 had for the streamlined social experience. While it's a good system, I feel it doesn't touch on the greatness of the 360. The Xbox One is missing key features like sending invites to friends to join games, on-screen friend and message notifications. Sometimes the voice activation doesn't work properly. Sometimes, the console picks up your voice while you're playing a game - the Xbox will listen to what you're saying and hijack your game by pausing or even exiting completely. The controller is worst of all. Without ANY WARNING what-so-ever, the controller will lose battery power (very quickly, I might add). At least the 360 would give you the blinking light show and say \"Hey, your batteries are dying - get a new set\" Surely, the Xbox One has a feature like that too, it's much better, and newer, of course!\" But, you'd be severely mistaken.The controller just dies and that's it.\nOverall, it's a pretty buggy system and I hope Microsoft will iron the kinks out soon.\nThat being said, the games are fun, the system is very fast, and there are a lot of cool features to give you, the player, a very enjoyable and fun social gaming experience.",

        "comment": "I feel I should have waited to get this product. The first night I brought it home I had one game with it, and it wouldn't load. After 1hr it still was at 0% so I looked online and it said to disconect from Live. Once I did that the game loaded to 3% which was enough to play. Once I was playing everything seemed fine.\n\nI like the idea that you can watch tv while you play however it seems you need to have a cable box. I tried to set mine up with just antenna use and thus far no luck, though Xbox does seem to know how to talk to my tv such as volume and turning it off.\n\nI am sure once more games come out I will enjoy it more, but the loading is a real pain. Even the demos I tried to download take forever, I could blame it on my internet connection but that isn't the only issue.\n\nOh about that game that I had issues loading, well it stalled at 92% never has reached 100% and when I reconnect to the internet it says I need an update for the game and again it just stalls out and I can't play while it is updating, so I have to keep uninstalling it and unplugging to let it build back up to that magical 3%. xbox support has been no help they keep telling me to do what I am doing and still no luck getting to 100%.\n\nIf you haven't gotten it yet WAIT. With the lack of games that are out right now I find myself using my 360 more because I only have the one game and I am almost done with it, since I can't get to 100% I can't do the online so I am trying to space it out till I have more things other then demos to play.\n\nIf you plan to use it as your multimedia hub it might be worth it to get it now.\n\nId still recommend it, if you are patient",

One, being that it had to always be connected to the internet. In this day, most people are not unplugged from the internet for more than hours at a time. The potential for games with this requirement were high! I also loved the ability to share my library with a friend. I'm a halo fan but most of my buddies tend to play call of duty. If they kept the system intact, I would be able to play his digital copy from my xbox while he plays his \"Physical\" copy. But this is the console we have, might as well get used to it.",

        "comment": "The Xbox One is a great console. It is very fast with the loading times as with the multitasking. Voice commands are good, and the Kinect is better than expected... free P90x, Insanity and other work outs available for those with Xbox Live Gold, and the workouts really are great. The game can tell u when u arent doing the move as the instuctor as properly, and once u do it right it will tell u... or if u are workin out a little slower it will tell u to try to pick up your speed... it tells u how many calories u lost and everything... its amazing. Gaming aspect is as great as the PS4 graphic wise because I have the PS4 as well, but for me I think Xbox has more of the games I want to play (Call of Duty, Battlefield, Titanfall, Halo, Destiny, Forza, etc...). Plus the network on Xbox Live is much better than the PSN (PlayStation Network). I haven't really experienced lags on my 10meg internet speed. The controller is incredible once u get used to it, and it is perfectly shaped in your hand. The downfall I can say is that the software on its operating system needs an update where it is easier to use party chat like on the 360, it needs to update where it shows how much battery life your controller has, how much space u have on your hard drive, etc... BUT like I said they will have an update so I'm alright. I'm still using my turtle beach headsets from 360 but really u can use any headsets because the Kinect has a built in mic that u can use for chat. Great console overall and highly recommended... My brother has an Xbox One as well so when I get to play on his Xbox, I can sign under my account and everything loads just as the one on my Xbox. My Xbox Gold is usable as well as the digital games I have as well, which is only Killer Instinct at the moment because my other games are discs. If you decide to get the Xbox over the PS4, you won't regret it!",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "However, the Xbox One really drew me in because of all the \"next-gen\" feeling features that it included. I'll go through each of those features and my thoughts on them now. I should say that I've owned the Xbox One for a few days now and put in about 40 hours using nearly off of it's available features.\n\nGames: This is the main reason people get the new consoles right? Ok, so maybe that's not totally true for the Xbox One because of all the media features it includes, but gaming is still at the center of what this console is meant to do. So far I have Dead Rising 3, Forza 5, and Just Dance as my games. None of these games is far and away better than the previous gen, but it is noticeably better. I expected this though, because it's not like we are going from standard def to high def like we did the previous generation. What really impresses me is the amount of content (e.g. zombies) on the screen at once the Xbox One can handle. I'm easily steam rolling hundreds of zombies at once with no slow downs. This is definitely in my opinion the best launch exclusive game. Forza 5 looks great and feels next gen, but the game itself doesn't really draw me in other than just for 15 minute burst racing sessions. Just Dance is a bit disappointing, but that is more a dock on the game itself. The Kinect portion works fantastically from what I can tell. Which leads me to,\n\nKinect 2.0: Wow, what an improvement. The precision is fantastic for both motion and speech recognition. I honestly don't think it's misinterpreted any command that I've given yet which blows my mind compared to where the previous Kinect was at. I can't wait till more games tap into this feature more. This might be the biggest surprise of the new Xbox One yet. I'm glad they made it such an integrated experience and bundled them together. It truly improves the experience. Yes, they could have made the Xbox One cheaper by not including it, but then it wouldn't be nearly as great of a product.\n\nInterface: This is the part that I think needs the most work. I'm familiar with Windows 8, so overall I think it looks great and navigation is usually straight forward. There are just some things that standout. First would be the friends list and messages. It's much harder to look at your friends online and read messages than the 360. I'm hoping this is fixed soon as it seems a lot of people are complaining about it. Also I think the \"pins\" could be done a bit better. Make it easier to arrange them. Sometimes it takes too many actions to get to popular games/apps. This is made drastically easier by voice commands though which I've started doing every time.\n\nTV Integration: This is the feature that I'm still getting used to the most. It takes a bit of time to relearn a new interface and way to navigation TV, but so far I think it's a big improvement over my normal cable box interface. Navigation is super simple with voice commands and it's a lot more customizable for getting to my favorite channels and looking at the TV guide. My favorite part of this is probably the \"snap\" feature where I can watch TV, but split the screen with something else. This has worked really great for me so far. I do think it can get even better though with better content to snap to the side. I also think the audio streams need to be able to get controlled. Right now they just play over each other which can be a mess. Should have voice commands to turn some on/off up/down. My wife also hasn't had much difficultly transitioning to watching TV through the Xbox. She's to the point now where she likes it more because it removes a lot of steps we use to have to do with remotes and she likes the voice commands.\n\nDesign: I'll admit that I don't really care about this that much. Is it big? Ya, it's bigger than my slim 360, but it fits on my TV stand no problem and I don't expect to move it. I like the look too. It's simple which I like. It's super quiet which is the most important thing in my book after my airplane engine original 360. The power brick is on the outside, but I don't care. That's hidden from view behind my stand. It keeps the Xbox One really low temperature which I hope increases its lifespan.\n\nController: The 360's controller was my favorite of all time. It felt amazing in my hand and it was extremely durable (I only broke one, and that's saying something considering I'm a notorious controller thrower). The Xbox One? I'd say parts of it are better and parts of it are worse. It feels a bit more like a toy than the 360. It's lighter and feels a bit more flimsy. Maybe it's not, time will tell. The triggers feel amazing, but the best upgrade is the thumbsticks. They feel great and are easy to use. I don't expect any thumb fatigue from these. Lots of people say d-pad is upgraded which I'd agree with, but I didn't really have any troubles with the one on the 360. My biggest gripe about the controller is piece of plastic that seals in the battery at the back of the controller. I don't think it seals tight enough and wiggles around slightly which bugs me. I also don't like having to pay extra for a battery pack and charger. The battery charge lasts a long time so far, but it better with the price that I paid for it. Better have a long shelf life or I'll be pretty disappointed. The controller is extremely responsive, but so was the 360's controller. I'd say overall I like the controller a bit less than the 360, but who knows if that'll change overtime.\n\nOther apps: The selection of apps for the Xbox One is good, but not great. It has all the standard ones like Netflix, Hulu, but is missing my personal favorite from the 360, HBO Go. They said they'll get that eventually and it can't come soon enough (the main reason my 360 is still plugged into my primary TV). Yes, you have to have XBL gold to use these which is a bit awkward. But my question would be why would you have an Xbox One and not have gold? If you just wanted to stream then a roku is way cheaper and smaller. Xbox One is mainly for gaming and XBL gold is super integrated into gaming and is one of the best features about the Xbox brand. Like I said earlier I'm not that sold on \"sharing\" features so I don't really plan on using like the Twitch app. Overall, the current selection is OK and what's there works well. It just needs more. I will mention that I'm a big NFL fan and like all the NFL app integration into the Xbox One.",

We can now talk to everyone we love &amp; miss, as big as life, like they are right there with us in the room.

Once I disconnect the FIOS everything worked again. The system itself has a power brick which surprised me. Sony has figured out a way to integrate that into the device itself. I saw someone tweet \" the best I play on the Xbox one is when I scream Xbox one 19 times\" I laughed because it's true. I know people say it will get better with updates. But I don't feel like spending $599 to be a beta tester. Returned and purchase a PS4 and I'm happier for it. It doesn't try to be what it's not.",

Your xbox isnt just an xbox its a gaming system, my digital tv, and home theater its great and you can switch back and forth quickly and with great ease. I am automatically signed in when I walk in the room that is a really cool feature. The next gen is crystal clear it looks so realistic. When playing sports game like Madden or NBA 2K it is very hard to tell the difference of real sports games and video games. It comes with HDMI cord for even better quality.

I don't know if I would go back to a playstation other than to see if any difference.\n\nYou can't go wrong with either system I'm sure, but the one is worth it and any updates would make it a better experience.",

When I first fired up Ryse son of Rome I was impressed by the realistic facial anamations ,refective armor on the soldiers and fluid movement.When I played Dead Rising 3 the numbers of zombies on screen at the same time was incredible! I did not experience any frame rate problems at all. Forza 5 looked awesome and ran smoothly with good competitive AI. I know some of the games are upscaled to 1080 p but I really had a hard time telling the difference. As for the kinect the voice commands worked good most the time.I used it alot when watching movies. The only gripe I have is the long install and loading times.As a PC gamer I am impressed with this console.By the way I dont think the PS4 is that much more powerful than the XBOX ONE.",

The voice command takes some getting used to and you have to make sure to speak clearly b/c it's a little sensitive (like when I say \"stop listening\" sometimes it thinks I said \"watch Disney\" and switches the channel). I am not a gamer, I bought it for my boyfriend but I love it! The Xbox Fitness is great and comes w/ lots of free workout programs (samples, you can purchase the full programs too). It comes with preloaded apps and you can add more too. Overall, I'd say you get your money's worth and there is something for the whole family to do",

It is the ultimate for lazy moments. Its great to not even have to touch the remote and be able to tell your xbox to do all kinds of stuff. But, the issues with apps crashing, lagging, and the selection of apps makes it frustrating. I often have to unplug the xbox for a minute to refresh it. Its worth it, you just need to be patient.",

The you tube app crashes. I do like the nfl one though. Really needs to have a plex type app though to integrate all entertainment. I have played forza, nba and dr3. All good games. Hope they release gta 5 for this though. Would also like to see a killer Mmo. Enjoying for now. Hope to see more in 2014.",

        "comment": "My son wanted the Xbox One for Christmas and was extremely excited once he opened the gift. However, since owning the new system, he plays the Xbox 360 more than the One. Not many games are available that he enjoys right now but I expect his play time to increase as new games are introduced. I enjoyed the many options available such as Skype, Blue-ray player, and internet browsing. The Xbox One also allows you to directly connect your cable box to the system so you can \"snap\" between the game or cable but I found this severely weakened or interrupted the signal so I had to connect the cable box back to the television again. No need to elaborate on the graphics since everyone knows it is better than the 360. One other problem I found is when my son and I are watching each other play (we only have one controller), the Xbox will disconnect the controller because it recognizes another person in the room. This becomes annoying after a while and my son quits out of frustration. If you primarily play video games, I will suggest the PS4; If you want more than just a video game system, try out the Xbox One first and compare the two systems since you will invest a good amount of money on your purchase. Overall, you can't go wrong with this purchase.",

They're really not to much different. The voice and tv integration is what kinda sets them apart for me. I'm not knocking Sony but I believe the x1 can keep me more entertained than with just games. Both systems are still really new and aren't even close to be being a finished product. I would recommend the x1 to anybody and I'm extremely happy with my purchase.",

I have my directv plugged into the xbox one, I use it for netflix, hulu plus, vudu, etc. The kinect integration is great, its just quick using it. Disconnect it if you dont like it, If your complaining about the price then odds are you should wait till you can afford it, But it is well worth the money. I also bought the ps4 on launch but I just have it sitting on my entertainment center, waiting for uncharted 4. To each its own. The xbox one controller just feels excellent for a shooter game. This next gen look great, especially on a samsung 64\" plasma. Buy or do not, but buy you wont be dissapointed",

The only games really available are XBOX 360 games and I'm not able to play those games with my friends that are still using the 360 (different servers for the ONE). The XBOX menu is complicated and you pretty much need a user manual to get a private chat started with a friend. The controller feels great until you have to plug in the microphone, the connector basically doubles the size of the controller. I tried running my satellite TV through the XBOX but you lose clarity and it's no longer high definition. I figured any of the apps available on the 360 would for sure be available on the ONE, if not more, but that is not the case (where is the HBO app?!). Microsoft needs to get some software updates going to improve this and make it worth the money.\n\nAll in all, I haven't had any \"problems\" with the ONE, I'm just disappointed. I actually hooked back up my 360 so I could play COD Ghosts with my friends that don't have the ONE. So now my $600 console is collecting dust...\n\nThe graphics look nice... but I hate that I spent $600 for graphics that are a little better than the 360.",

        "comment": "What can I add about the Xbox that hasn't already been said? The system is quite a bit bigger than the 360, both in size and weight. I would say it is close to the original Xbox in size. Setup is simple, but the device still revolves around using the Kinect. I personally don't have mine hooked up (I don't have room in my living room to use it, even though they say that the focal length is less than Kinect 1). This leads to extra steps at startup because the system uses the Kinect to log in profiles instead of allowing the user to select a primary profile and logging that in. You would think, if there is only one profile on the system, it would be logged in as default, but that does not happen. As a result of not using the Kinect, there is a little symbol of a crossed out Kinect in the corner of the screen while on the menus, reminding you that you are using the system in a way not intended by Micro$oft. If I can say there is one great improvement, it is the controller. Even with batteries installed, it is lighter than the 360 controller. The shoulder buttons and triggers are redesigned and more comfortable to use. The controller rests easily in the hand. Biggest downside for me right now is the game lineup. I am not impressed by the launch lineups for either system. I chose the Xbox over the PS4 because there were more launch titles coming out for the Xbox in which I was interested. Unfortunately, so far that number is two. Both games (Forza and Ryse) look great and I would recommend both. Time will tell which system gets the better games.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "The console is a great leap from the original Xbox, but only a minor leap from the Xbox 360. The graphics, interaction with Kinect, and controller got beneficial upgrades, but the interface, achievement system, friends system, and communications have either remained stagnant, or suffer from being rushed to market too soon.\n\nOverall I'm very happy that I own the Xbox One. I would recommend it if you love Xbox as a brand, enjoy the Xbox exclusives, and don't mind waiting for the library to fill out. If you're still happy with your Xbox 360, you can afford to wait a while, the Xbox One will only get better with age.",

        "comment": "Fun, smooth running system with very easy transitions between profiles, games, and television. Very low loading times, and has never overheated even when an all nighter has been pulled playing a game. Some issues with updates provided for some of the games, but otherwise has been great fun. Absolutely love the integration of voice and spoken commands in games through the Kinect, it has opened up a whole new level of gameplay. Would recommend the use of voice commands in Dead Rising 3, as it makes the game that much more fun. Does take some getting used to learning the voice interactivity to go between profiles and to bounce to the TV, as well as changing channels and such through spoken commands. Overall, love the game system.",

Young toddler that cannot use a remote or hand held device yet could still get a ton of use out of the XBox kinect with the right games. I really hope Xbox develops that market.\nThe system setup was easy for the most part considering how much tech is involved. My only minor complaint is that the voice recognition has won my wife over but I have friends and family over sometimes and it would be nice if they could use the remote to turn on the xbox and not have to use voice commands since most of them are not familiar with the xbox controller.\nAgain, overall I love the apps, especially amazon prime. This system is only going to get better as new games and apps come out. There is a ton of potential for the product to become even better.",

It would be a Lot better.er. I think the xb1 mandatory Kinect is a way to clear warehouse stock frfrom when Kinect didnt sell for the 360.",

I have a lot of difficulties setting Xbox up the customer service was good but not very knowledgeable about the new product. After returning one Xbox. And then running into the same problem with the new one I got. After about 15 straight hours on the phone with Xbox. I figured out the problem myself. If you have an old Verizon modem. You may need to get a new one because at the demand of the Xbox one is greater than any thing on your network",

But I have owned the other 2 Xbox's and I am a fan of the Microsoft gaming platform. So I returned he ps 4 and paid the extra for the XB1. It's not backwards compatible - I wish I could benefit from the library of the 360, so I could use my existing games and purchase used games while waiting for new XB1 content. Yes, I know I can use the HDMI pass through and keep a 360, but I don't want to maintain 2 systems, 2 controllers, etc.\n\nBut the graphics are excellent, I am enjoying the free content with Killer Instinct, Kinect Sports Rivals, and the demo games, and Forza 5 is excellent. As time goes on the library will increase, there will be updates to make Live better, and soon we'll be able to buy used games and not go bankrupt!",

As a parent, I must say it's REALLY disappointing to get new hardware that can't work with existing software. I mean come on Microsoft - really? Imagine an iPhone where you couldn't transfer your old music to the new phone. Or an Android device where none of the apps worked and you needed to buy new ones.\n\nEven if MS had to throw in a whole separate board to run the old 360 games it would be worth it. The cost of electronics is peanuts these days.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I have mix feelings about this console but it is indeed a good console none the less. There a lot of strange things with the Xbox One going on and I see this console is going to need a lot of updates to really show what future this system holds. The Xbox 360 have many features that makes it simple that this console does not. I'm just going to break this down as quickly as possible:\n\nTV and Video apps : I do enjoy the video and TV features very much. The voice commands makes it much easier to get to switch video apps. Sometimes voice picks up and sometimes it doesn't; often times you have to repeat yourself but when it works...it works pretty well. I like having HDMI IN and watching cable TV on it but if you ask me it would have been so much better just to put a cox input in the back of the device and work with cable providers in areas. Apps pretty much needs Xbox live so you have to pay a monthly or yearly sub to use things you already pay for like Netflix and Hulu, This absolutely makes no sense when their competitors like Wii U and PS4 doesn't have these apps behind a paywall. Why do I need to pay to use You-Tube? So far app apps work without a hitch, but there are some Apps on Xbox 360 that missing from here. Also I don't even know why DLNA is missing from this console. That is something they should add back in.\n\nOS: Its pretty much Windows 8 on a console. Some will hate it and some will love it. that depends on the person. I really don't mind it but the OS really feels like its still suck in a \"BETA\" stage at this time of writing. Everything is in deep layers and its not very intuitive. There have to be a better way to organize this console OS. Once Microsoft fix this it will be an awesome. I would like a way to organize my pins better personally so I can have games and apps from each other.\n\nGames: Games looks great but I'm a PC gamer and have already been spoiled by finer graphics. That's not to say the Xbox One doesn't hold its own and the games looks awesome for what it does. Enjoyed Killer Instinct and I have to say one of my favorite on the console; pulling off combos on this game is very satisfying. Forza Motorsport 5 is a beautiful game and pretty much a great racer in my eyes. My girlfriend enjoys playing COD and Dead Rising 3.\n\nEvery game I have tried have to be installed to the hard drive, There is no way around it. You will simply have to wait until the game is ready to play. For me this is not an issue because I use Steam but I pretty much can see how console gamers would be annoyed at the wait. But then again with games like GTA V and COD Ghost on PS3 and Xbox 360 had to be installed on the HDD. That's pretty much what the future is now so you have to get use to it going into the new consoles.\n\nHere is where my problem comes in...The Digital games in XBL marketplace is still the same price as when you buy it in stores. Amazon has Forza 5 pretty much for $50 while on Xbox Live is still sitting at $60. For them to expect us to go all Digital with out games why not have some weekly sales already? if you want to be like Steam show some promise to the gamers that you can pull this off Microsoft. Otherwise Digital will always be dead in the water.\n\nDesign: Its a black box and yes it looks like a VCR. Which doesn't bother me at all because at-lease now this console is well ventilated from the Original Xbox 360. What bothers me is the glossy shiny black on this console and its really annoying. It baffles me why they didn't go with a Matte color all the way around. This thing is a massive dust collector and after 2 days of use it already collecting dust upon it.\n\nKinect 2.0: I like using it to be honest. When it works...it works well. My girlfriend and I often find ourself using the voice commands the most. Like I said before sometimes a repeat is necessary but I do see updates coming in the future to fix these problems. None of the games I tried that used Kinect 2.0 really work that well with motion controls but the one app that did work perfectly was Xbox Fitness which I love using. Kinect Sports Rivals was not a good example and it was more frustrating then fun.\n\nOverall: Yes, The Xbox One is a good console and its really solid. I have to hand Microsoft that even after all the terrible PR they are going through. You really get a lot for your money....but to me this console isn't worth the price tag of $500. I would wait until the Xbox One is $400 or less because truthfully the Xbox 360 and PS3 would still tie you over for at-lease 2-3 years. While the Graphics are great they are nothing earth-shattering that you would need to have RIGHT NOW. This console needs A LOT more updates and I do mean a lot before it can really shine but I believe once it receives that treatment this will be one of the best consoles out there even with the negativity surrounding it at this moment. I will not be returning my Xbox One because I see there is a pretty big future and promise as long as Microsoft stick with it.",

Right now if I want to watch recorded shows on my DVR I have to dig out a separate remote which is a pain. The speed at which menus and applications run is great and while I haven't played too many games on it, what I have played looks amazing.",

        "comment": "We love our new XBox One. Our oldest son took it to college and we miss it already. It was nice to have an integrated interface which made NetFlix, TV, and system usage so easy without an extensive remote search. The voice command was very handy, calling \"Xbox\" and a command, like \"XBox Mute\". We did notice that it has trouble with higher women's voices which put mom at a distinct disadvantage to the kids. The Kinect is nice too, so you don't have to find the remote, you ARE the remote. Some suggestions for improvement would be media store to buy movies, which we do occasionally with our Apple TV. Alas, our oldest has taken it to college and we will not see it again until summertime.",

I can jump from my tv, netflix or gaming. It's a pretty seamless transition.\nAs far as graphics go, some look stunning (like Forza) and others look like a really pretty 360 game. We all know it takes a couple of years for games to really tap into the horsepower.\n\nAny who, I'm not here to argue which system has the most horsepower. All I can say is, for me, I love having this machine that plays awesome video games and has all these bells and whistles. If you want a PURE gaming machine and save a 100 bucks, go with a PS4. But if you want an entertainment hub that plays games, you can't go wrong with XBOX ONE.",

        "comment": "I like everything about the Xbox One when comparing it to the Xbox 360. Obviously you can't release a new system without an overall improvement on pretty much everything and Microsoft definitely delivered. Graphics, processor, controller and Kinect look, feel and operate wonderfully. I leave the Kinect camera off most of the time, but when on it can be used for recording game clips and video chat (via Skype) and more. I think 4 stars is a good rating for its initial release. I have no doubt that as new games are released and system updates arrive this machine will grow to a 5 star powerhouse.",

        "comment": "I have had my Xbox 1 for just over a month. While the game selection isn't great yet overall I am impressed. The graphics truly do \"wow\" you at first much like the 1st time you saw a 360 after playing an original Xbox. It took me about 20 mins to get everything set up. If you have set up a computer and harmony remote I don't think you'll have an issue setting up XB1. I have it set up to control my TV and AV receiver. I was impressed when I went to set up my AV system that all my equipment was already loaded with their ir codes and I just had to find the model # for each (much like setting up an Harmony Remote). One other suggestion if you use Surround Sound and have your cable/sat box running through the XB1, make sure you enable the Beta box for digital surround sound. Another nice addition to XB1 is the addition of 5Ghz N wireless, it's nice to be able to separate video to the 5Ghz channel and leave other devices on 2.4Ghz.\n\nThe only negative(s) I have found are:\n1) voice changing channels-for whatever reason just about every channel I request sounds like E!HD to XB1. A channel I never watch so using the voice to change channels is about a 50/50 proposition for me. It also has a hard time figuring out what Comcast Sportsnet Bay Area is...so keep your remote handy.\n2) NFL App-in the small print to use most of the great features of the NFL App you need to authenticate. I have accounts with DirecTV, Comcast, and Suddenlink none of which have a deal with The NFL to authenticate the NFL App on XB1 (or iOS).\n3) there is a known issue that as of this writing causes freezing issues with 1080i pictures sometimes. This happens after the machine has been left on for an extended time. Rumor is Microsoft will soon be pushing through a firmware upgrade to help resolve this.\nIf you run into this problem put your finger over the power button on XB1 this will have the machine do a full reboot and should fix it.",

RYSE has got to be the most incredible visual game I have ever seen..Very impressed with this title as well as Forza...Trust me, with these Microsoft exclusive titles they make having the XBOX one a good purchase..

Either that or route two consoles together (assuming your 360 didn't die on you) just so you can play them.\n\nThe pass through video quality (for television) was horrible. I use DTV satellite and it was terribly bad. Not to mention there is no good way to control a setup where an A/V receiver controls all of your input and sound.\n\nOverall, Microsoft really didn't deliver on this console; at least not yet.",

The good news is I have found out how to work around some of it's problems after caller customer support half a dozen times.\nFirst game I tried to install from disc I started about 1630 then gave up and went to bed about 5 hours. Found out you should disconnect from your network before installing new games. Second game install want much better dead rising 3 only took about 35 minutes then it had to update. That update took 2 1/2 hours. I hear there is a 13 mg update coming. Now the system has just shut off twice so far while playing dead rising.

        "comment": "Got the console in early January. Initial set up can take some time. Thought I had the green screen of death, but if you leave it (can take up to 15m) the update will finish. Also had to finish set up before it would connect to recognize my profile...after that no problem.\nI do run my cable through the xbox and it recognized my system and had no problems with set up. The xbox version of a tv guide is clunky at best. Does not recognize the names of all channels like HGTV off the top of my head.\nOverall voice commands are OK, hope they improve. Biggest issue is volume drowning out voice commands. My kinect is right under my TV so after a certain point the xbox can't hear me.\nThe snap feature is pretty sweet, but when you snap TV while playing a game it seems to lag..i've seen other people report the same thing.\nSeems like I have a lot of negatives, but I see it as stuff that can improve but doesn't take away from my enjoyment. I own 2 games, COD and Assassins creed. Enjoy both very much. Overall I like it a lot, and would love it if they improve voice commands. Price is high, but that's what gaming systems are coming to.",

        "comment": "This is so much more than a gaming machine. To me, one of the best, and lessor known features, is Xbox Fitness. This alone is worth the price I paid for the Xbox One. There is so much free content you could literally do a different work out each day.\nAnother nice feature is the interface. I know there has been some negative press about the interface but it's really well done. I believe most of the negative press is user error rather than a bad interface. The Xbox One is very specific and the quicker you learn the commands the better it responds. For example, if you say, \"Xbox On\", the unit turns on and sends a command to turn your TV on. But you have to say it exactly like that...Xbox on. To turn the unit and your TV off you simply say, \"Xbox Turn Off\". See the difference? I'm guessing some people say, \"Xbox Off\" and it doesn't respond. Trust me, the interface works as long as you use the correct command.\nIf you are on the fence between the PS4 and the Xbox One give the Xbox One a try. Xbox has more titles and it's far more than a gaming machine. It's very cool to talk to the Xbox versus reaching for a remote. An perfect example is telling Xbox to \"Mute\" or \"Turn up/Turn Down\" the volume on your TV. With Sony, you have to have your remote close by. Both consoles are in need of more games. And both do streaming and blu-ray playback.\nI've been using my Xbox since launch day and I'm very pleased with it.",

The interface is east to use and you can switch platforms very easily. The major downfall is the lack of installed Dolby sound and the inability to use my 360 headphones for gaming. I have to run sound through my TV directly to headphones and does not have the same sound experience as the 360. Chat feature only works with inferior headset provided by microsoft. After market headphones are not fully capable until microsoft releases a patch cable. As of today, no news when that cable will be released. I am amazed why Microsoft did not do a better job with the gaming sound on such an expensive device. Once the sound issue gets updated, the Xbone will deserve 5 stars.",

        "comment": "The Xbox One makes a convincing argument as an entertainment centerpiece. The Wii U brought a universal remote capacity to consoles but the One feeds the television directly through the device. The Kinect voice commands mostly work once you learn the cadences except the one time out of 10 it frustratingly doesn't. \"Xbox on\" is usually the biggest culprit for me (a bad one to not work 100% of the time, huh?). TNT, CBS, and other three letter networks can be sketchy in voice commands too. Hopefully the March update will enhance voice recognition. Despite the occasional frustrations, I already can't imagine my living room without it. The One easily found my receiver and television in setup and I added my Vizio 2.1 soundbar through settings later. This has drastically limited the growing number of remotes I use.\n\nCurrently the One lacks HBOGO and a few other streaming services. ESPN, Netflix, Fox, and others show great potential for the device in streaming user experience. I still use my Apple TV on occasion as we await these companies releasing their app.\n\nGames are not a console mover right now but that should change in 2014. Most feel like slightly better 360 games or near exact rips. With time developers will start pushing the console's power. The Kinect 2.0 has been a treat for my girlfriend with Just Dance and other games of that variety.\n\nOverall, the system has a great deal of utility but Microsoft needs to work out the kinks. Also, 3rd parties need to get their services and games transitioned into this generation. I can see the one being a great purchase today for techies but a better purchase this Fall for pure gamers.",

Dead rising 3 is tons of fun as an exclusive title and the multiplatform games look great as well.\nthere are some UI issues in that things have changed significantly from Xbox 360 but Microsoft has promised a patch that should address many if these issues soon (march 2014).\nover all i am very satisfied with my purchase",

Once it's setup and the settings are where they should be it moves along with ease voice commands are sweet especially adjusting the volume and turning it on and off the voice commands work about 95% of the time I suggest watching the tutorial for the voice commands I feel like most people complain about it because they're not using the commands it was built to hear and it's pretty specific once you get used to it it's a breeze. Gaming wise it's def an upgrade at graphics and the framerate is silky smooth. There aren't many games out right now but remember its a brand new system the games will come in time. I did have some bugs and hiccups along the way with some of its features but Microsoft customer service cleared it right up and haven't had an issue since Microsoft will be addressing the issues as they develop with patches once again this things only a couple months old. I'm impressed and would recommend to anyone that enjoys a sweet lil piece of entertainment tech",

        "comment": "I have been looking for a laptop for sometime because I was not happy with my Windows RT tablet. I got so frustrated with it I decided as an early graduation present for myself, I'd go out and buy myself a descent laptop I could use for college and beyond. I was going to go with a Windows 7 laptop, but my sister has a Mac and says she loves it. My cousin is an Apple guru and highly recommended Mac to me. So after a few days of thinking about it and what I'd use it for, I decided to make the plunge and bought my Mac.\n\nI have to say, once I bit Apple's fruit, I never want to go back to Windows, (even though I still know how to use it and all.) I LOVE practically everything about it and have virtually no complaints about it! The only thing I have against it is that it is a bit on the pricy side. But other than that, I love every aspect of my Mac and would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a good, thin, lightweight laptop from a tried and true name.\n\n10/10 Love it!",

Xbox Live is as good as it gets for online multiplayer gaming. Kinect works great for recognizing me and signing me in automatically. The unit is quiet, powers up fast and has worked very well for me. Proprietary chat port on the controller is a bummer. Microsoft knew they were changing the port and should have gotten this info to gaming headset manufacturers so they could have shipped an adapter. Microsoft says they are going to release an adapter but still have not 3 months into launch. Additionally, they need to update the Xbox software so that the output for headsets allows Dolby 5.1 and Dolby 7.1. Another obvious option that should have been shipped with the console at launch. Other than that, it's a great unit.",

Don't expect Ps4 to be the clear out winner xbox one will only get better. In 2 years the games should look amazing. It's already been noted that Ryse son of Rome is the best looking as in visual game of the next gen. I have to say if more games will look like this, we are in. Store for some great games",

        "comment": "Xbox One is the latest generation of Microsoft's console gaming system, and it's better in every way than the Xbox 360. This time around the Kinect is included so no need to purchase it separately. The new system is much more powerful and gives you the best possible gaming experience. In my opinion it's superior to the old Xbox 360, as well as the PS3 and PS4. One killer feature is the ability to pass your cable or satellite signal through the X1 using the HDMI cable, then use voice commands to change channels. Speaking of voice control, the X1 continues to build on what was started with the 360, it's much easier and more flexible to control with voice commands.",

        "comment": "I had an Xbox 360 and wasn't sure I wanted the new system. How much better can the graphics be? I had Battlefield 4 and FIFA 14 for both systems and can tell a difference between the two systems. For Battlefield 4 the detail is better, especially the shadows. FIFA ran better and looked better too. Honestly, the games are only part of why I like the system. I have Comcast and my cable box is routed through it. Now I can change channels, view the guide, and more via voice command. My Xbox will automatically turn on the cable box, surround sound receiver, and TV when I turn on the Xbox. Voice controls allow you to turn it on or off without pressing a button. I used the Xbox to Skype with a friend this week which was awesome. I use it to watch Netflix and Bluray movies. My Xbox Live Gold account transferred from my Xbox 360 so I can still quickly parry up with friends. The voice quality is better than the 360. Definitely get the play and charge kit for the controller so you aren't putting batteries in all the time.",

What is lacking right now is the entire reason to get a console in the first place: games. Right now that other console is winning with almost 50% more games, and that is only counting new releases. Microsoft deciding to not allow the playing of older titles on their new console makes this problem even worse. I have a hard time recommending this console right now.",

It makes you download the games onto the console, and I don't have the strongest of connections, so it took quite a long time to get the 4 games I bought up and running. But once I did, everything runs smooth, love the voice commands. Just can't wait to see what else they bring out with it to make it even better!",

        "comment": "As I am writing this review I just notcied the date. I bought this beautiful beast in june, picked it up in November. I had my original X1 returned to Microsoft because the face plate was just a tinny bit lose. Yes I know that seems very picky, but this is a 500.00 piece of hardware I want it perfect. I'd return it if there was a faint scratch on the bottom, I want it perfect.\nNever the less, my new X1 runs like a dream. Visually stunning with Ryse and Forza, quick on ghost, and the controller is comfortable with hours of Dead rising 3 under my belt. I've tried to burn my console out but it's handled everything ive thrown at it.\nOn a real note, the kinect has issues. Its fantastic for chating and when people say \" when it works its a dream\" its a true statement. Skype is a beautiful thing on the X1. Although I dont use it a whole lot. The thing is \"Xbox On\" works 25-50% of the time. Most of the other commands even if the xbox is listening you need to say \"xbox\" first. \"Xbox volume up\" works okay it only brings my TV volume up by 2, then 3. All of these issues will be fixed with a patch coming in March. Plus Microsoft is giving it a 10% power boost so all games will run native 1080p. 60fps.\nAnyway get an X1 you wont be disappointed as long as you give it a real try. Go through the ropes with it, set it up. Play your 360, PS3, PS4, Wii, Wii U on it. There is a lot of promise to this console the future is bright and big for the X1. SO! Thank you for reading, I hope you enjoyed my review please hit the \"Helpful\" button!\n\nPS: The rechargeable battery pack really saves time, I use this for my X42 and my controllers.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I've been a dedicated Mac user since 2003, and a fan of Mac notebooks for that entire time. I've owned a Titanium, a G4 PowerBook, and a few Intel PowerBooks, but this is my first foray into the modern portable Mac; all my others are desktop systems. I bought a MacBook Pro principally for its weight (or lack thereof) as my intended use for the system was to augment my iPad and iPhone with a good data entry and content creation platform, and to keep it light enough to travel with the Wintel piece of junk work forces me to carry. The system is speedy enough for any task I've thrown at it, and has unbelievable battery life! It has been everything I thought I wanted and more.\n\nSome insight into my product selection: I considered both the MacBook Air 11 inch and the MacBook Pro 13 inch. I rejected the 11 inch because the screen was so small, and it was a non-standard aspect ratio. However, now that I've been using my 13 inch MacBook Air for a while, I have to say it looks gargantuan! I frequently wonder if the even smaller 11 inch system could have done the same job. My gut says I made the right call, but it's questionable enough that it's worth noting. The hardest rejection to make was the Retina display on the MacBook Pro. It is simply stunning in every regard, and if I thought I would be doing a lot of photo editing (unlikely, probably just arranging collections for me) then I would have spent the extra money to buy it. In the end, I intend to use my MacBook Air for word processing/text entry, some presentations, and the occasional application or web site I can't use on my iPad. The Retina display just wasn't a necessity for my needs.\n\nHaving said all that, if the rumors are true and a 12inch MBA comes out this year (or a 12 inch MB Pro) I may well trade up. That form factor would address my size/weight concerns in all likelihood (my MBA is as heavy as I will go) and I can't imagine any future Apple product without a Retina display.",

        "comment": "The Microsoft Xbox One is great for some people but some people they may not enjoy it as much. Let me begin by saying that when I opened the box my first reaction was that it is massive. The console its self weighs over 12 pounds, and the power brick is also very bulky. When I plugged it in it felt like an amazing machine that runs so fluid, so fast, it was wonderful. But the one thing I love most about the Xbox is its remote. The remote is so responsive, so fast, it feels so comfortable in your hands, and the weight is so perfect. And from what i heard if your racing in Forza and you crash on the left side the remote will vibrate on the left, not just the whole remote. Nothing can be done to make the controller even better! The programming in the Xbox is also amazing i love how you can switch from one game to another with out even pausing it! And if your in a middle of a race on Forza and you want to hop on something else really quick. When you go back on Forza it will automatically continue the game from where you were. And depending on what type of person you are you may or may not like the features on the Xbox, I personally don't like the features. Here are some of them: when you walk in the room the xbox turns on by itself, you can talk to the xbox to turn on and off, if you go to a friends house it will automatically know your face and download your profile. It almost seems like they have taken it to far with the kinect. All that stuff may be great but when I wanted to start playing game I put in Forza 5 and it just wouldn't work. I waited for a few min and still nothing. Then I put it in again and nothing again. I put in gta 5 and nothing again. And so for me not worth it. And also the price is outrageous! $500 for the console, one remote, and the kinect! Madness! And for most people they are going to buy another remote and some games. Well I did, it piled up to about $700. So for me $700 on a console that doesn't work isn't right. I would give it 5 stars if my Xbox worked, but since it doesn't I would give if 3.5 if i could.\nI would buy it but not everything at once. If I were to go back I would get the bundle its self and one game. Then over time another remote and some more games! Now just be careful! When your out there picking out your Xbox make sure you pick a lucky one!",

The sound occasionally goes out while watching TV and you have to unplug and re-install the cable box to the xbox. The xbox kinect also struggles with understanding your snap requests and you find yourself shouting at the TV to close a snap while watching TV. If you have the volume up on your surround sound, it is difficult for the Kinect to hear you say requests to change from TV to games to Home.",

        "comment": "First I have to admit I was pretty much split down the middle when it came to picking the Xbox One or PS4. Obviously I went with the Xbox One but I will get the PS4 later for sure. So if you are in the same boat and trying to make the same decision, perhaps this review may help you a bit.\n\nPros:\n\nTo The Point:\nEasy out of the box setup. If you're looking to just use the Xbox for purely gaming, setup is very quick. There is a 500mb mandatory update right at the beginning. After the update, everything else is pretty simple and you can get right into playing your game disc or downloading games to play (Live is required.) Personally, I watch tv, mainly sports so my setup also included using my Xbox to control my TV, A/V Receiver, and cable box (comcast). There is a super user friendly walkthrough for this entire process, so don't be nervous about not getting it right. Just be patient, follow the steps, and you'll be good to go.\n\nYou're in Control:\nWhile the HDMI in featuer is really cool, what I love most is the fact that Xbox allows me to control my television with voice commands via the Kinect. I can even control DVR functionality with voice commands as well. This is very intuitive and pretty cool to use. I've heard of some people having trouble with the Kinect understanding their commands but I haven't run into this issue yet.\n\nHidden Gems:\nAnother feature I kind of discovered since it wasn't really advertised, at least to my knowledge is the fact that I can seamlessly resume a game or app I was last playing before I turned off my Xbox. For example, if I turn off the Xbox in the middle of playing NBA 2k14, when I come back the next day, I resume at the same spot. This is very convenient.\n\nBells and Whistles:\nOther features that are more obvious, like snapping apps, using gestures to expand and collapse apps, etc. work well but I find that I dont use these features too much for now at least.\n\nCool and Quiet:\nThe system boots up fairly quickly and is very quiet. And from what I can tell is able to stay pretty cool even after hours of staying on.\n\nPretty Visuals:\nThe games look amazing. I have two games that I purchased: NBA 2k14 and Dead Rising 3. Two very different games but both have stunning graphics. I don't know exact frame rates or how to get that info but from what I can tell, both of these games run smoothly. If this is the first generation of games, then I am excited to see what the future holds, which leads us to....\n\nCons:\n\nWeak Library (for now):\nRight now I'm enjoying NBA 2k14 and Dead Rising 3. NBA 2k14, is available on other consoles, even last gen. Dead Rising 3 and a couple of other games are Xbox exclusives. To me, the current exclusives and game library overall is lacking. Watch Dogs, and Project Spark (beta access should be available this month) were delayed. I know a few games are set to come out in spring and summer but the real blockbusters are set for winter 2014 (Watch Dogs, Destiny, etc.). At least we have something to look forward to.\n\nI hope this review was helpful :D",

I have it in a shelving unit under my cable box . i have comcast and the TV app works awesome. it also controls my bose speakers but shutting them down as well as my tv and my cable box. i can do pretty much any action without touching the controller, from turning it off/on, switching between apps ,selecting a movie, changing a channel, or even controlling your dvr. the graphics are great and I'm sure they will get better as more games come out. some games are glitchy but I'm sure that will get fixed too.",

The Xbox interface is not what you would expect - voice commands for controlling TV functionality hardly ever work and there are some \"dead\" pathways in the software that leave no way to return to a main menu - you have to use the game controler to get out of the trap. All in all, I would recommend this to someone for gaming but nothing else.",

Keep in mind, I plan to install Windows 7 on it, and I saw no need for a touch screen, as was standard in the PC ultrabooks at this price range. I just wanted something well-built, fast, and focused on a long battery life. It doesn't get any better than Apple when it comes to build quality. I almost feel like I could chop wood with this thing. Mac OSX is actually a decent operating system, and I'd keep using it, if not for several key programs I require. But installing Windows is no trouble at all. I chose not to pay extra for the larger SSD, considering it did not include double the RAM at that price. I figure I'll just hand this off and buy myself a new one when I run out of space. For now, an external hard drive was a better investment.",

        "comment": "Coming from psx, ps2, and ps3. I wanted something different and wanted Kinect. Researched before the purchase and I knew what I was getting. TV integration is cool and really enjoying it. Kinect voice control sometimes doesn't work and mostly gimmick. However, it's cool feature and I always use it. You don't need to pick up gamepad or remote to control, just call \"Xbox\". Kinect with dance games and Xbox fitness is really works and it is enjoyable.\n\nThe product is far from perfect yet as it is missing some features and OS is still buggy. It is more expensive and under-powered than ps4. however, all those bad talk about xbox one doesn't bother me. I'm enjoying my purchase. If you care all about graphics, yes, go buy ps4. If you want something different and want Microsoft exclusive game, get the xbox one and enjoy it.",

The new dashboard takes some getting used to and I still don't remember how to unsnap without backing out of the current game or video. The new Kinect is very sensitive and shows a lot of promise, especially for dance/workout titles, but there really is not much to choose from yet. Once a few dashboard updates have come out and the games library fills out this will be a worthwhile console, for now it is an expensive Blu-ray player.",

It is a very nice machine except for the fact that i had to purchase a 79.99 usb superdrive that isn't Blueray compatible. I also had to buy and extra cable to get the HDMI going. The screen is not retina. 720p. Not a big problem if your not into display. I am unfortunately. Everything I own is Full HD. Another problem is that it heats up awfully fast when you are playing a program such as a game. The CPU is not strong enough to take on even the Sims 3. Never had that problem with PC. Other than those things. I do really enjoy the Mac. I am new to mac. Always been a PC guy. After this one dies on me or is outdated. Ill prob be back to PC world. PS Memory is limited. Recommend an external hard drive.",

        "comment": "I received my Xbox One from Amazon on Friday at 11:30am. I was fortunate enough to get the day one edition. I had a chance to test the Kinect voice commands and Dead Rising 3. When the voice commands work, they are amazing. I was able to say Xbox Snap TV and my roommate could watch his football game while I played Dead Rising 3.\n\nThe motion sensor was accurate when I played Kinect Rivals or when I was shaking a zoombie off in Dead Rising. Most new innovative technologies have issues in the beginning. Sometimes the Kinect did not hear me. I think this can be fixed in a few software updates. I look forward to the innovations with Kinect, since it is bundled with every console.\n\nI played Dead Rising 3 and it looks good, but not amazing. I was amazed at the shear number of zoombies the game could get on the screen. Waves and waves of zoombies would be produced. There were frame rate issues and some serious aliasing at times. I hope they add a patch like they did for AC4 and COD:Ghosts for DC3. I have only seen a little NBA 2K14 and it looks gorgeous so far. I have not played Forza 5 or Ryse, but both of those games look like they will show the power of the system.\n\nI enjoyed using the HDMI pass through on the Xbox. I have my gaming PC going into and it works with no lag. I can seamlessly go from my PC to my Xbox, all in the Xbox interface. The Xbox glass app for your phone is really cool! You can use your phone to control TV, Blu-Rays, menus, and everything Xbox One. I downloaded it just to try it and it is a great alternative to use use phone instead of your controller for media apps.\n\nHonestly, the Xbox One is an ambitious piece of technology. It is trying to be the center of your living room. A lot of bets have been placed on the Kinect leading the way. I think it is possible, but the software needs work. I am most excited for the potential innovations of the Xbox One over the PS4. Overall, I like the system and I look forward to the Xbox One future!",

I haven't bought a game system since 360 came out so this is a huge improvement. The only real complaint I have is that I would love to play some of the games that I have missed out on and classics that I have access to from the 360.",

For instance, Battlefield 4 on the Xbox One is one of the BEST FPSs i have ever played! I mean going from 32 players online to 64 is absolutely crazy. When they talk about all out warfare that's exactly what they mean. And if you're a racing fan then Forza 5 is the game for you. That has everything that gear heads could ever want and hope for. And the new controller does take some getting used to but once you do it feel much more comfortable and way better than before with all of the new features that they added. The new overhauled Kinect is also something great. The camera now records in 720p with HD Audio. Overall this is a big step up from the 360, especially if you're a Xbox fan. I'm very happy with my purchase and I'm really excited to see how this system evolves as the new games release and how the community starts to grow.\n\nNow the bad stuff, the really only bad stuff that I have found in my opinion would be the party system as well as the overall UI. While the User Interface isn't bad it's just very different from the 360 and does take some getting used to so you can learn where everything is at (but that's also another reason to use the Kinect, it makes navigating everything much quicker.) But the party system currently is a very big pain in the butt to learn. Microsoft is releasing an update on February 11th to fix and add a lot of stuff that people wanted or didn't like about the UI or anything else. All in all, great system, really fun to play, and something that I really look forward to watching grow.",

        "comment": "I am tech savvy and do extensive research before making a choice. At first I was leaning toward a PS4 due to the simple reason of it being priced at $399 and more powerful hardware. I researched on websites including Youtube videos. I was very hesitant about my purchase, but all I can say is WOW. This is a great system. Kinect works about 90% of the time and it amazes me how responsive it is and it is easy to learn with the tutorials it has on Xbox Live. My only gaming purchase thus far is Dead Rising 3 and I must say the graphics look pretty good and its a fun game. Eventually graphics improve over time once gaming developers fully understand the machines capability. Overall, I have no complaints. If this was the \"other system\" over time it would sit and collect dust due to me being a casual gamer, BUT the Xbox One is in constant use so you really feel like you get your moneys worth regardless the extra $100 for the kinect. You won't be disappointed with this buy!!",

        "comment": "Solid gaming system, easy to setup and the included HDMI cable is appropriately long enough for any normal setup. Kinect voice commands generally work great when properly setup and set a part from speakers (should be at least one foot away from any speaker), gesture commands also work fairly well but take a bit of getting used to. Provides smooth switching between games and apps (especially when using voice commands to jump directly to something else). It's always satisfying to get home, walk in, and simply say \"Xbox On\" to have the Xbox One, TV, and Audio Receiver all turn on without needing to find, or touch, any remote.\n\nThere are a few things that can use some changing; however, they're already addressing many of them with upcoming announced updates (2/11/14 and 3/4/14) so I'll hold off on listing them. Two were no USB keyboard support and no controller battery indicator, but those are being resolved 2/11/14.\n\nLong story of randomly composed thoughts short... I'm quite satisfied with my purchase, and as with the Xbox 360, it will likely get better and better with each update.",

The power of the system is ready for the future and is too advanced for the current technology of most entertainment areas. I don\u2019t pay for TV service so I can\u2019t use the snap feature to watch TV and play a game at the same time, but you can still do other snap features aka Skype. The new Kinect is 18 times better than the previous version and works fantastic. The Kinect even has a 4-40 screw mount on the bottom for attaching to a tripod (which I use). The angle adjustment is manual unlike the previous model, which I think is good, but others my think it is a step back. I like the manual adjustment because it is just easier than fighting the software to get the right angle and you only have to do it once. The controller no longer feels cheap and you can tell the time has been spent to get everything right. The only other problem is that there is only one USB located anywhere near the front. It\u2019s on the left side by the front corner and is a pain to route the charging cable (not included) to charge the controller pack (also not included). The other many USBs are located in the back and who wants to crawl and squeeze behind the entertainment center every time to attach a device. The console its self is VERY heavy and quite a surprise. Be sure to put it in a secure location that won\u2019t fall. Buy the Charge and Play kit the same day you buy the console, it will save you money and time. FYI the XBOX ONE smart glass is a separate app from the 360 smart glass. The XBOX one is a must buy and it feels like it will be a great product for years.",

I wasn't sure at first whether to go with the Xbox One or the PS4 however the functionality of the new Kinect system combined with the Halo franchise won me over. Personally there are only a few minor annoyances when you first get the product. The console has quite large updates, the party system as of now is still a little sloppy, and the amount of launch titles are slim. I stil love this console regardless due to its ability to deliver a fantastic gaming experience.",

The controller is much better also. I just wish more headsets/games came out more quickly. LOVE this, so glad I got this over the PS4, I have friends with PS4, and they are jealous!",

After buying it I wasn't as satisfied as I wanted to be especially after spending close to $700 on a game and extra controller. The voice recognition is awesome though. It has never messed up on me yet and it can even be loud or quiet environments and it works like a charm. It is a solid console and don't see having any problems in the future except with HDD space which doesn't take long to fill up with bluray disc based games. Overall I'm starting to slowly be impressed and excited to see what happens next.",

As much as people are saying there is a difference in the games when you do not have them side by side you are not going to notice much of a difference. Right now i use my xbox one more than my ps4 because of all the media options it has and because i love being able to snap between apps so quickly. also right now the xbox one has the standby feature that lets me turn off my xbox and not lose where i am at in the game as soon as i turn it back on its back to playing my game. While there is much to like on this new system there are a lot of little bugs that need to be fixed. Kinect voice recognition is not great. you can manage your storage and you also cannot see your battery life. i know that lost of these things will be fixed over time. but if your interested in the new xbox then i defintely recommend it .",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I've had this system for a few months now so figured I'd right a real review. Not all these five star one sentence reviews saying it's the greatest ever.\n\nNow I've been an Xbox fan since the first system and had my doubts as soon as the press conference was aired and some of the facts and details started emerging about the console and games. It seemed like they were most worried about the connect and watching tv on the system, not actual gaming. I put off getting the system at launch until I could play it and Playstation and read some of the reviews. I finally picked it up since my brother was nagging for me to get one and the games one 360 started going downhill fast. Most of the players submitted to the new system leaving few people left on 360 for games like MW2.\n\nUpon setting up the system and starting to mess around with it I didn't get the hype and supposed cutting edge technology. You could feel it was geared towards trying to be an all in one entertainment system and rushed to meet a deadline. Right off the bat somethings started bugging me. Like no rechargeable controllers, no wireless headsets, etc.\nThe cable on the headset is really annoying and seems to get tangled and in the way more than a standard cable. I've also had alot of problems with the headset not connecting properly and having to re plug it in several times till it works (several friends and people online have the same problem). The controllers eat through batteries insanely fast and I'm glad I already had rechargeable batteries laying around. Pretty lame not to have a rechargeable controller or wireless headset. I guess so they can sell it to you later and make you buy accessories\n\nThe interface and how it's set up is pretty annoying. If your in a game talking to someone in a lobby you have to go back to the home page just to see who's online, which cuts off your mic unless your in party chat. Then when you click on friends you have to wait for the lag as it pops up a feed list telling what people have been doing for the past few hours before you can click on friends. You also have to join a party just to play in a game with someone which is a huge pain. So you have to join your friends, try to get in a lobby together, then for games like Forza, switch off party chat to hear everyone else in the lobby. Also there is no avoided player option now. So get someone who's terrible or team killing or crashing on purpose and you can't do anything about it. Also muting in all the games I've played is a pain and still a pain in the lobbies.\n\nOnto the Kinect sensor. Yeah it's a cool toy and that's about it. The wow factor looses it's luster pretty quickly. The in game commands are neat but I could easily push a button to do it, besides having to mute my mic to yell medic without yelling over the voice chat. Also news flash people. The Kinect still sounds terrible if you use it as a mic unless your tv volume is really low and playing in a tiny room close to it. It still picks up in game noise and sounds like your across the street. The main annoyance is that when you unplug the mic, Kinect automatically starts acting as a mic. So if you don't want to talk or unplug the mic to answer the phone, Kinect still pics it up. I don't know how they thought that was a good idea. No you have people not using the mic and blaring the volume and you have to hear echoes all game.\n\nThe graphics aren't that big of a jump for being next gen. I've got a high end 60'' led and good surround sound and don't see what all the hype is about. It is a bit noticeable, but more sound quality than anything. I've seen it at other people's houses and no difference either.\n\nThe games are a complete disappointment for the most part. All of them have bugs and can tell were rushed. I'll go more into the games I've played so far. It seems like the days of buying the game and maybe 2 map packs are done. You get a sense after awhile that the game is short on purpose just to sell add ons later. I'd easily be happy playing MW2 and older Project Gotham Racing games.\n\nBattlefield 4-\nWow this game was messed up at launch. Story mode wouldn't save the campaign, so you had to play the whole thing in one sitting. Way to easy on the hardest difficulty too. I'm not the greatest gamer but I could easily walk through the game. You also felt like you had your hand held and with the team the whole time too. No cool solo sniper missions or stuff like that. I still have every once in awhile have it freeze on the black screen in multiplayer and a few times in campaign. I finally broke down and got the premium and can say this game is worthless without it. Between the add ons, maps, they even connect you to games quicker. Unreal. The quality of players is terrible (worse than the average cod player) I see people level 40+ consistently going negative like 4 kills and 20 deaths. Alot more trolling on this system as well, especially if you use claymores. I keep having people team kill me cause I've set up a claymore and they run into it when I'm off the beaten path. The worst part is you get booted for it and people will do it on purpose as well.\n\nCall of duty- Ghosts\nI got suckered into another piece of trash from this franchise. After the initial problems with BF4 I decided to give this a try and the benefit of doubt that it might be good with it being on a new console. WRONG. The story mode was ok but short and eazy. You also have your hand held by your teammates the whole time. No real good characters and they expect you to think a few guys can take on the world and all it's armies. Not like previous games were your against a terrorist cell or a small group. It also ends with the usual \"we'll have another game in a year for ya\". The online graphics and feel are a joke. It's like black ops with new guns that all feel the same and numb. Some of the maps make zero sense with the story of the game too. The maps feel like they started with a box and saw what they could stuff into it. Again they tried to make flowing maps to keep the gameplay quick but all it does like before is make a haven for campers. A few of the maps you could literally stand still against some backgrounds and blend in too good.\n\nForza 5-\nProbably my favorite game for this system, partially because they've ruined FPS games. There are less cars but it doesn't seem to have that big of an affect. It's just lacking in tracks, especially F1 and larger circuits for the higher class cars. I can't believe they released this game with out the Nurburgring. That is ridiculous! But I'm sure they'll improve with updates the price of the game..... Another aspect I hate is parts of the track that bring you to a dead stop. I know it's to keep cheaters from cutting turns but they've seemed to do it on parts where the slightest mistake and the race is over, then on other tracks you can cut entire turns and take them wide all the way to the wall with no problem. Once again, trying to stop cheaters has made others suffer.\n\nThe quality of gamers is pretty low until late at night. You get alot of people flying into turns with no brakes, waiting for the leaders to crash into them, sitting in tight parts of the track and going just fast enough to turn off the ghosts settings. You should be a ghost if your a lap or two down. Basically wait till the kiddies go to bed to jump on.\n\nApparently muscle cars and Jeeps are super cars in this game too. I don't care how much work you put into a 5000 lead sled, it won't brake, turn, and handle like a sports car. That brings me to the tuning aspect of this game, which is out of hand. This game takes alot of skill out of actual racing. I've had guys blow by me smacking into walls and making mistakes in the same car and pull away with huge leads. It's a war of how much time you have or what's the best tune you can find. I mean a new GTR in c class? C'mon.\n\nNow I've always considered my self a pretty good gamer. Usually top 3 in most races, positive k/d ratio and on the top of the teams. This game just takes alot of the skill out of the equation.\n\nassassins creed black flag-\nCan't say much about this game in detail as I only played it for a bit. I actually really liked it compared to the previous ones I played. I can't imagine the online being great.\n\nMy only hope for this system in the near future is Titanfall and the supposed next Project Gotham Racing game (if that ever happens). I'm sure Halo will be another let down and waste of money. If your going to pick this system up and sick of the last few COD games, don;t get ghosts, nothing has changed and their just milking that franchise.\nIf your new to Battlefield, it's way different than COD (possibly why I see so many people going negative). The first few guns you get will make the game very stressful.\n\nAll and all, thanks Microsoft for dropping the ball. This system had so much hype and potential and you guys failed. I can turn on my tv and switch to games without you and the Kinect.",

        "comment": "Disclaimer: I own both a PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nI picked this console up on launch day, and so I've had some time to use it in various ways. This console has some great potential once Microsoft gets the bugs worked out of it. Both the PS4 and this console were rushed to market as it is apparent by the issues both console's have seen. I've used the TV function and it works great when it is able to load. I've contacted Microsoft about the random apps not loading and crashing, and they mentioned that many of these issue will be fixed in the next software update, so stay tuned.\n\nAfter the overhaul that the 360 saw in it's long lifespan, I know if Microsoft doesn't drop the ball, this console could do some great things.\n\nI will say I love the new controller, it is much more comfortable than the 360 controller, but in my opinion, still a better controller than even the Dual-Shock 4 from Sony, even though that is an improvement.\n\nI like the hardware design. It blends in very nicely with my home theater gear, and I don't even notice it. I also like that the console detects how much ambient light there is, and dims the logos on the Kinect, console and controller appropriately.",

There isn't yet any warning of a low battery in your controller and every once in a while it sticks on screens.\n\nThere is a rumored update to launch in Feb/Mar 2014 that is supposed to address many of these issues. Also, learning the interface is a bit of a curve, but they have a nice tutorial to help ease the process. All in all, I highly recommend.",

        "comment": "Was definitely torn between the Xbox One and a PS4 for a while. Went back and forth comparing the two, and when it came down to it I ended up picking the Xbox One, and so far I have not been disappointed. Been a bit over a month now and I have had very few issues.\n\nFirst and foremost, the new graphics engine is great. Having used the Xbox 360 for many years, you can see a noticeable difference with every aspect of game details. Switching between games/apps/tv, etc. is quick and seemless (most times negotiating with a simple voice command).\n\nThe ability to stream my TV through the Xbox and watch a show while playing a game is pretty sweet. Also, all I have to do is walk into the room, say 'Xbox, On', and it turns on the TV, Cable box and Xbox (though I will say you are borderline shouting commands at times to get it to register). The audible commands extend to TV as well, with the ability to say 'Xbox, watch ESPN', etc.\n\nThe price was a bit of a wallet-stretcher, but the Kinect is much improved, including a HD camera, facial recognition and audible commands. XboxOne will sign users into profiles when they walk into the room, and it will automatically assign a user profile to a controller by reading facial patterns and their relation to the IR signal from each controller.\n\nAll this being said, the incredible graphics engine, the advanced improvements to Kinect (both visual and audible commands), multitasking ability, and the complete All-in-one system capability led me to the Xbox and it has not disappointed at all to this point.",

That just feel like a big screw you to xbox fans. Also I can't get smart glass to work with it. I still have a 360 sitting right next to my One and use it all the time. Pretty much only use for my 500 dollar xbox one is to play blue ray and that's about it unless I spend 60 bucks on a limited selection of games to play.

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I picked this up about a month ago and I have to say I've been pretty pleased with the console so far. I'm sure you've read plenty of reviews detailing the great features the X1 has so this review will shed some light on some of the things I don't like about it. First off, this has terrible install times. You must install every single game to the console, there is no way to get around it. When I brought it home I spend a couple hours messing around with the voice and gesture controls. After that I put in a game and found out I couldn't play it right away. It took almost 4 hours to install COD: Ghosts. To be fair, you can play the game after it installs enough but the features of the game are extremely limited. I could play the story mode but I couldn't access any other part of the game until it finished installing. To be fair, I've read that COD takes the most time to install. I was able to install Tomb Raider completely in an hour and a half.\nDownload times are really slow. I could download an update for a game or a new app on my 360 in a couple of minutes it takes at least an hour on the X1, which makes no sense. I have a pretty good internet connection and I've never had long wait times on my 360.\nThe X1 also boots slower than the 360. I don't leave mine in standby mode because I don't want it eating up my electric bill so when I turn in on it takes a couple minutes to boot.\n\nThese are the only drawbacks that I've found. I hope Microsoft pushes an update and fixes these long wait times because these are the only things that make it feel like this isn't next gen gaming.",

Love the voice commands and the personalization of each user in my house. Microsoft finally got XBOX Live accounts right where we just have to pay for one account and the whole house has access. Forza is ridiculous, Ryse was fun, and got on the Titan Fall Beta...FPS games won't be the same, its that good. From the 360 the Kinect in the XBOX One is so much more sensitive and doesn't' have as much of the distance form the device issues that I had with the 360. Kids love Zoo Tycoon. I love walking into the room saying XBOX On, Go To TV, watch NBC all while I am just sitting down. Watch live OTA TV and hooked into my TV and Stereo with no issue. The Skype interaction will zoom in and out, pan as people come into view automatically. Just really cool. This is just so much more then just a game system, not even a comparison....",

        "comment": "I was originally going to get a ps4(I still am soon enough) but decided to check out the xbox one since it was much more readily available. I bought Ryse and Forza motorsport. Since then I have bought battlefield 4 and still continue to be blown away with how great the graphics are and how fast the gaming is and being able to go back to watching tv or netflix and vise versa within a tap of a button or voice command. Speaking of voice command, I had a great time playing ryse with the kinect. I never thought I would be the multiplayer type gamer but the xbox one incorporates it in such a fun way that even the shyest person could have fun or at least see the fun in it. I can't even think about using an xbox without a kinect after having used it. If your still thinking about it and CAN afford it, I would say go for it. Titanfall is coming out soon and let me tell you, the beta was so much fun to play. I can't wait to get the full game and also Thief is coming out next week. I'm being an optimist for both systems but I am glad to be on board with the xbox one and not be biased towards any system. From what I've experienced with the xbox one, so far, so good. I dig it and I'm the last dude you would have thought to have said that.",

        "comment": "Now that I have a teenager and my son is about to turn 11 years of age, we decided to graduate from the Wii and purchase this gaming system. It is my intention to STOP with this one, it is very expensive and it will be that last one that I buy. The clerk in the store persuaded me to 'upgrade' to the XBOX one; as it will have all of the newest/ best games... with many to be launched in March. It has already been a long two months waiting for these games to come out. We are not traditional \"gamers\", whose interest is peaked by the delay in releasing a new product. We are a family who would like to be able to utilize this system to play games among a group of friends/ teens who want to 'hang out.' As of this point, XBOX one is not at all marketed to this type of consumer: the games are all extremely violent or sophisticated, with the exception of the LEGO game, that holds zero interest for us. I hope that in March, I will be able to purchase some of the successful Disney games that the standard XBOX can handle. As I said early, the graphics are fantastic and the features of membership are nice; however, this gaming system remains primarily unusable until some variety of family friendly games is released. It is a frustrating place to be in and I am regretting not purchasing the older model.",

If you want to see what the Xbox One is capable of with respect to graphics I'd suggest playing Tomb Raiders. I was somewhat skeptical about the Kinetic and have to say that I was surprised. It does a very good job at recognizing voice commands and the gesture function works fairly well. The only thing that really ticked me off was having to purchase Xbox Gold to watch Netflix. What is worse is that their apps are not as good as the PS4 and unlike the PS4 you need to pay to use most of the apps.. I must say that I was also very impressed with the Wii U and think this is possibly the best all around system for everything except playing blu-ray movies. The PS4 was the most unstable of all three systems and the graphics are only fair. If your a serious gamer I'd say get the Xbox and if your looking for an all in in one system get the Wii.",

He really loved the voice activation and the Kinnect that comes with it but after a few months, he plays his Xbox 360 just as much as the new Xbox One. The games available for this system are really fun but there are not as many games for the One and it is not backwards compatible with old 360 games. We are also having a really bad time with the game ejecting at random times. We exchanged our console for a new one after it happened the first time, but the new one does the same thing. When this happens, you lose any game progress you haven't saved. I don't want to hate on Microsoft but this One really isn't worth the money.",

        "comment": "This review is for those with projectors and 3D TVs. I'm writing this while setting up the Xbox. A few things that are absolutely ridiculous for a new gaming console or even an old one for that fact. 1) The Kinect only has a 9' cord and NO extender available. This means that most people with a projector will have a Very hard time using the Kinect. You know, the reason why you're paying $100 more than Ps4. I have the xbox on a box in the middle of my room so the hdmi can reach my receiver and the Kinect can be under the projector. 2) No 3D blue-ray support. That's right. You can't play 3D blue-ray movies. Even the PS3 and a $40 player can do that. The Xbox one gets you no closer to one media device than the xbox 360 did. But at least the 360 has a Kinect extension cable. Heck, even the original Wii sensor had one. Save your money and buy a PS4 or plan on not using the Kinect or watching 3D Movies on the Xbox.",

The graphics are not as good as a PC obviously because if they were the console would cost over a thousand bucks. The Xbox One is trying to be ahead of it's time.\nWatching TV on the Xbox One is not the way to do it. It's very slow when you're trying run the TV and a game at once, and switch back and forth. Also, the audio of peoples voices is cut out in TV shows when it have my cable box plugged into my Xbox. When I have my cable going straight to my tv, sound is fine.",

The game line up may be a bit slim at the moment but what's available are awesome games, and a even more awesome lineup of upcoming games, but if your still on the fence, take plunge you won't be disappointed.",

I'm not a fan of the Xbox controller but that's probably just because I'm used to the Playstation controller. I list Kinect as both a pro and a con because when it works it's pretty cool. The problem is that it only works about 70% of the time. Games load quickly and I like being able to pin apps I use most often to the home screen. My wife likes Xbox Fitness so that's a plus. Also being able to watch TV through the Xbox is very cool. No more switching between my gaming system and the TV. Very convenient.\n\nOverall I'd say the Xbox is OK. Not really worth $500 though. We'll see how it improves once more games come out.",

I really don't know what made me decide to go with the xbox at the last minute but im SO GLAD I DID! What a way to get introduced to the xbox platform? The graphics are AMAZING, I love the voice command features, I love the Kinect, I love everything about it. im also a windows 8 user so I get to sync my xbox and computer to each other. I also have my xbox hooked up to my cable box and TV so I can shut it all off and on just by saying 2 or three words no remotes needed anymore. Only downside is the limited number of games out for the xbox one right now, and I had an issue with the black screen of death but luckily I had already googled any known issues with the xbox one before it happened so I was aready prepared in how to deal with it. overall???

        "comment": "I am a loyal Xbox user and have had my 360 since it first came out. I should have learned my lesson back then when it comes to buying next gen consoles too soon. The Xbox One feels like it was rushed to get to the consumers (which it was) and as a result operations feel very clunky.\n\nThe voice recognition is frustrating to use. The kinnect camera only recognizes me 50% of the time, and I now have unplugged it as to avoid the frustration. One night I noticed a \"buzzing\" sound when I was trying to sleep and discovered the power brick has a internal fan and when you have your xbox in stand-bye mode the brick light and fan run 24/7. As you can imagine, a fan running non-stop is not going to last forever so I turned the \"voice on\" feature off.\n\nThe user interface also feels clunky and frankly is a major step back from the current 360 UI. Bottom line is, like the 360, I'm guessing the One will go through some drastic hardware and software updates over the next couple years and I am kicking myself for not being smart and waiting at least a year to pick one up. They won't have any decent games for at least a year anyway.\n\nLastly, the plastic used for the console and the controller feel very cheap compared to the 360. I'm not sure if they did this to reduce heat or what, but hard to imagine why the 360 should look and feel more expensive than the next gen model.",

You can connect it to your tv, cable box, etc and control everything in one place. If you turn on the Xbox, it will turn on the tv and cable box as well.\n\nThe biggest annoyance is the voice control. It tends to pick up men's voices okay, but my girlfriend only has 60% accuracy of the Xbox even acknowledging her existence. Changing channels with voice commands is neat except it often mixes up TBS, CBS, PBS and others. Volume control moves volume up of down only 3 clicks at a time. If need to move it a lot, you have to repeat yourself several times and it takes awhile. Also, fast forward and rewind are a bit off. It doesn't have a delay where it rewinds a few second after you say stop like my cable box does. That coupled with the fact that it takes the Xbox a moment to recognize my speech, I often fast forward or rewind too much.",

Can't just pop in a disc and start shooting.\n- for gamers whom like to have a large library of games. Storage space will be an issue. Not a question of if but when it affects you.\n- not all headsets will work. Not until adapters are made and released.\n-controller buttons click. Rather loudly actually\n\nWhat I love\n- kinect is awesome. Facial recognition and voice commands are top notch but there is a learning curve. Both for you and the console.\n-graphics\n- system speed and responsiveness\n-games so far\n-The oneguide\n- bluray player (finally!)\n-app selection is steadily increasing but will take time to be a decent assortment.\n\nBottom line. If you can spend that kind of money. Spend it. The xbox one is worth it.",

Make sure to add the headset adapter also so you can use any headset you like with it and it will play games, tv, or any other source that you use. My Beats by Dre sound amazing during Dead Rising 3 and Battlefield 4. I can't wait to test them in Titanfall! The only downfall is waiting for really good games to launch, some games have been hit or miss but the good ones are great.",

The graphics look great even though you hear people talk about the frame rate and resolution. The only complaint I have is the way they changed the party system but that is being addressed with the new update. Being able to snap TV or other apps so one person can be watching TV while you play games is great. Now I don't have to choose whether or not to play or watch sports.",

Its quick enough to start up and hibernate if you are just closing the lid and opening the lid. The microphone is one the best I have used when compared to the microsoft surface for a similar tasks. I can go through the entire school day ~ 5 hours of school use i.e taking notes or web surfing on the battery.\nThe cons are you can't have a lot of media files i.e music or video stored on the actual device. Any other software that is processor or ram intensive i.e matlab, photoshop, etc you might want to look at a more powerful computer",

I wish it played the 360 games though but I just plugged the 360 into another HDMI port on my receiver and everything is good to go.\n\nCons: For whatever reason it loses the voice control and I have to unplug all the connections in the back of it and let it reboot to get it to work right again. I have found out though, that if I turn on my controller it also turns on the Xbox, so problem solved I guess.\n\nI love being able to walk into the living room and say \"Xbox on\" and all of the components turn on. (Xbox, TV, Receiver, Satellite). Graphics are also amazing. It's a big leap forward for Xbox and I am very happy with my purchase. Now MORE GAMES!",

It recognizes me in pretty low light, automatically logs in other people it recognizes, voice commands seem to work better and also picks up movement for games better. There are several issues I have noticed so far. One is sometimes when navigating it will lock up for a minute or so. Second, several times the screen has gone black when a game changes screens. I have had to power it down and unplug the system and restart. The multimedia aspects are nice but I didn't find them awesome. Using the voice commands are neat but seem a bit cumbersome.",

Not only do you have to pay to have NetFlix, you have to pay for the Live Subscription with Microsoft to use NetFlix. When going through setup and it comes to the Microphone, it is ultra sensitive, my wife turned the water on in the kitchen and it said to much noise and I could barely hear the water. Although when I tried to use a voice command, it didn't hear me or I said it wrong lol.\n\nBut once set up, the product is great, it does come with a 14day Live Trial, but after that you have to buy it. So if you plan on using it for apps like NetFlix, or any of the other movie options out there, you have to buy the Live Subscription, so on top of the 600 to buy the Xbox, you will need to spend another 30-50 on the live...for the price of the Xbox One it should come with the first year of live at no extra cost.",

One is xbox music you have to pay and its $9.99 a month or $99.00 a year. I think gold members should have it for free as windows 8 users have it for free. I think there is limit for so many hours per month. Its hard to justify paying for it when apple has free radio and you can go to Internet explorer and play Pandora or other free internet based apps with commercials. In addition xbox one missing many of the apps that previous version had. I don't pay for Hulu or Netflix as I have Comcast and all movie channels and it was nice to have HBO to go and Comcast on demand as I had access to hundreds of free movies as I paid separately for Comcast. I also didn't hook up xbox to cable box as I have X1 though Comcast and pay enough for it not to use xbox for it and x1 has Pandora and facebook and xbox does not. There is a lot of room for improvement and I hope xbox makes changes for the good like adding apps and games to xbox so members have access to them. My old xbox I had a lot of apps and games like pinball and other good games in market that were inexpensive but fun to play, I would expect to pay for membership to have access to a lot as the xbox one was 200 more then previous xbox and it would be nice to think of xbox one as an upgrade, but cant say that yet. If friend wanted this system would say to wait a few months for improvement.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I'm giving it a lot of slack, as it hasn't been a year yet, and that's usually a rough period where the device is really put through the trials of general consumer use. I think future software updates will definitely make remarkable improvements, but the hardware, at least to date, hasn't given me any trouble.\n\nThe voice-activation features is a lot of fun. Being able to just talk to my TV and tell it to pause feels like I'm in the future. There are some games that take advantage of the voice activation to mixed results, though. Need For Speed will occasionally pick a random word you say (either to a friend or to yourself) and think you're asking it to change the view, or go to the map. That's frustrating. I blame the game maker though for providing FAR too many keywords. I don't need to say \"map\" (or the myriad other words it thinks are \"map\"), if I can just press a button on the controller for the map. Being able to say \"GPS repair shop\" and get directions to the nearest repair shop, though, is fantastic.\n\nOn occasion, the voice activation gets a little difficult, though. You might find that it understands you completely one time, and then not at all an hour later. Again, I think this will only improve with future software updates.\n\nHand Gestures are definitely not there yet. It takes too much effort to get it to even recognize your hands first, while just using the controller instead (or even some voice commands) is far simpler. Microsoft needs to figure out what they're doing here. A hand gesture just needs to work, and won't be useful for everything. For example, I can either raise my hands up, wait a few seconds for the Xbox to recognize them, make fists (grabbing the edges of the screen) and pull them together to go the the Home screen, or I can just say, \"Xbox, Go Home\". So far all I've wanted to use a gesture for is just to swipe through pages. It's not responsive enough to be even half as efficient as just using the controller, though.\n\nI do love the auto-sign in feature. That it recognizes me and signs me in as I sit down on my couch is as creepy as it is helpful (I expect the creepiness to fade over time). On occasion, though, this doesn't kick in at all, and I have to do it manually. Ridiculous that I would get frustrated with this, considering that I've spent the last decade signing in manually.\n\nThere have been a few times (I think four total since I bought it nearly two months ago) where the video output has blanked. This usually happens when a game seems to be busy loading or saving or doing something transitionally (i.e. processor-heavy activity). The only solution then appears to be to turn off the Xbox and unplug it. Simply rebooting doesn't help. I haven't checked forums yet to see why this is happening or if there is a fix coming soon. For all I know, it might just be some weird quirk in the interaction between my Xbox and TV. Seems like the kind of problem that will be fixed in an update soon. Still, it's easily avoidable if you just wait to go to the Home screen until after the game resolves it's activity.\n\nI might have seemed to have had more criticisms than compliments to say, but that I still like my Xbox should say something. I see a great deal of potential in the product, and am looking forward to what they do with it in the future.",

The Xbox One has the potential to be a great console, however, just like its predecessor, it will take some updates from Microsoft to work out the bugs. When you get past the forced install for all games because blu-ray has horrible read times, the overall experience is very satisfying. This is where the HDMI pass through comes in handy as you can watch TV of play another console through the Xbox One while waiting. I am impressed with Kinect 2.0 which is a major upgrade and just awaiting content to be released.\n\nOverall the Xbox One is a good console that can be made great over time with some work from Microsoft.",

Sometimes those changes help the platforms progression and other times it hinders it. The graphics in the one have upgraded a lot from its predecessor. But the hardware seems to be not quite up to date with modern gaming pc's. Though it may be lacking, the interface has some good features- the voice control is one of them.\nIt enables you to records and extends gameplay while both hands are still operating a game or doing nothing. It's a good and confusing interface. This console deserves a 4/5 for inivation, but has some way to go till it becomes fluint or \"perfect\".",

My guess is like the 360, once they've spent enough time on it the Xbox One will be absolutely killer.\n\nAll that said......it was a half baked product that probably wasn't ready for prime time. Party chat is terrible. We own two in the house and have to buy the games twice. The system is not ready to run in quick boot mode without all kinds of troubles. It's very frustrating when it's not working.\n\nI'd still buy one again, but I kind of wish I had waited a year for them to iron out the kinks.\n\nPS....Titanfall is crazy fun and probably worth all the troubles.",

        "comment": "I was planning on holding off on the Xbox One until a little bit later when Halo 5 is going to be released, but I got bitten by the One bug and decided to go for it anyway... and I am glad I did. This is a great piece of hardware. I love my Xbox 360, despite the RRoD I had with my first one. The Xbox One is a worthy replacement. It is fast, the graphics are stunning and the responsiveness of the new Kinect is greatly improved making using it actually doable. The only gripe I have at the moment is the lack of backwards compatibility with Xbox 360 games. This really needs to be fixed sometime in the future, especially for later games like AC4. Thankfully the workaround with the Xbox 360 being connected to the HDMI IN and playing it through the TV channel on the ONE saves me the hassle of finding a way to free a fifth HDMI port. Great console, anxiously looking forward to what's coming down the road.",

        "comment": "Deciding what console to purchase at the start of a new hardware generation can be a tough choice. Ultimately, one of the foremost deciding factors should be software exclusives. You can rest assured that juggernaut franchises such as Halo and Gears of War will be exclusive to Microsoft's new console.\n\nBut what if you're still on the fence? I've owned my Xbox One for about one month now, and here's my first impressions of it:\n\nThe console runs everything very smoothly. The menu interface, media apps, and games run exceedingly well. A noticeable difference from the past generation. Console start up takes only seconds to complete. Voice commands work most of the time, and I've rarely had to repeat a phrase more than once. With voice commands, you can turn on the Xbox and navigate any sequence of menus quickly and easily without ever picking up a controller. The controller itself is an upgrade from the Xbox 360's, which was a very well received controller in its own right, with sturdy construction. Triggers feel great and the d-pad (the 360's biggest weakness) is greatly improved.\n\nYou can record game play clips approximately 30 seconds long, edit and save them after your gaming sessions so that those incredible moments you have while gaming can be shared. It's easy to look at a friend's clips and you can upload them to any device that uses the OneDrive app, which really opens up the possibilities for gamers who want to share and broadcast their experiences who don't have nice video capture setups.\n\nSome features taken for granted with the 360 are strangely absent from the Xbox One, such as friend notifications. Being notified when your buddy comes online or starts playing the same game you are have not been implemented yet. Microsoft's goal of the One being the \"all-in-one media experience\" are only half-realized at this point. Many of the media apps that exist on the Xbox 360 are not present on the One as of yet. The big ones are there, such as Netflix and Hulu. But many others are not. I find the lack of a radio station app such as I Heart Radio particularly disappointing.\n\nThis review is the state of the Xbox One's features as of March 2014. A lot of the features and apps I mentioned that are absent will be added in the future. So if you don't mind watching the Xbox One growing from its infancy to its full potential, then this is an excellent buy with a promising future. But if you're looking for a feature-rich experience right out of the gate, you won't find many things truly new that aren't available on the Xbox 360 currently.",

One of the best things about it is the integration with other media sources. It works very well with our DirecTV. The voice activation took a little getting used to, but we like it now. The only thing that needs to be done to improve the console is for more games to be released for it.",

Some of it sounds muffled and not clear and I tried to fix it in the menu options but havent had any luck also its not loud by any means ringing or otherwise. I had a droid bionic and i just downloaded an app and got great sound from it for being a phone. Tried that with the Samsung and no success. I miss calls because of this. Other than that the phone does get hot! just put a good case on ti and screen protector on it and that helped tremendously. Love the phone for all the other features. The phone is thin and has no gripping so it does need a good protective covering i advise purchasing same day of phone purchase! One other prob.....reception issues, didnt have that prob with my droid in the same locations.",

However, these have already been dealt with in the last update.

I love the achievement and gamer point set up along with many of the new features such as recording your game to share with others. The graphics are great right now and will only get better as the game developers find a way to use this console to it's full potential. The voice commands with the kinect camera is a very nice add on, such as when you want to turn your console off after watching a movie or netflix you can say \"Xbox turn off\" and just like that it turns off without you turning your controller on. This is on giant step for the next generation and I am really happy with my purchase.\n\nNow my one big complaint is seeing the amount of games that are still being released on the previous generation consoles while the current generation only has a handful, I know its typical but I would really like to see game developers roll out some current gen only games.",

My work machine is an HP Elitebook (HP really should have named it EliteAnvil) running Windows 8.1, this MacAir replaced a Gateway running Windows 8, etc\n\nI have an 2006ish iMac that I use as a server at home, still running great, but I digress.\n\nI tried the 11.6 but it was too small, I tried the Macbook Pro with Retina but I run dual screen at home so I did not get the full benefit of the allegedly better screen.\n\nI purchased this laptop because I needed something that will boot up quickly in case I have an idea that I needed to get on the web and also something very light. This MacAir fits both bills perfectly. It's insanely fast to boot up and is very very light.\n\nThe drive space is scant (I went with the basic 128gig) but so far I am at less than 30% used and I don't foresee myself adding any more than I have since I use the cloud heavily so it will work out.\n\nOn the older iMac, whenever I load my iPhoto library it starts having fainting spells, not so on this MacAir, works very well and very speedy. I don't do photo processing or have Paramount Pictures as a competitor so I don't know how it will work with heavy photo/video usage. But as far as regular Joe surfing web, doing accounting, school work, writing emails, etc it hasn't missed a beat and it ridiculously fast.\n\nI recommend this to you if you need a higher performance light weight rig (i5 processor is very speedy especially when coupled with SSD) and if you want a laptop that you can actually carry with you on the road.\n\nGo ahead, treat yourself.",

When it was time to upgrade the hardware I was intrigued by the MBA's super light chassis and amazing battery life, but concerned because there wasn't yet great support for Linux on the latest model. I've been using OSX exclusively since making the switch and, expect for the lack of an included package manager, the switch has been painless. If you're a solid BASH user you'll find it's the default shell as of OSX Mavericks. The MBA has been highly performant for light scripting and some number crunching in R. Battery life kicks butt and ergonomics \"just feel good\". It recognized Samba shares on my home server immediately as well as my Seagate GoFlex network drive.",

But to off set\nthe high price, you get in return prestige, the wow factor from people, high resale value, less issues with viruses, an O/S that is easier to operate, free upgrades to the next operating system.. windows will charge you a boat load of money to do that..... oh, and I forgot you also get the best touch pad around... Trust me when I tell you you need great touchpad to work the computer seamlessly and that is what you get with any apple laptop.. This is unlike a windows machine which often enough have touchpad issues that sucks basically. No other no way to say it better.. That is one of the reasons I got an Apple laptop because of the touch pads of many windows machines leave a lot to be desired.....",

        "comment": "as an xbox 360 player venturing into nex-gen gaming on to the xbox one there are a few things to remember that nex-gen is not here yet and this is only a 50% leap into graphics to the xbox one until there are more games and developer's that take that leap forward into nex gen. There are some games that offer a graphical leap from the xbox 360. as for features the Kinect 2 and snap/tv add ons are great but its hard to see this going forward for Microsoft due to cable and direct tv slowly dying off. we are in a world of streaming and cable companies are dying off slowly. even tho the snap features works great for those that have cable. the snap and tv features are pointless which makes the xbox one a ps4 with the PlayStation camera. going forth the xbox controller feels great in your hands if you have small hands that is. the xbox 360 controller is still one of the best controllers ever made. even with the new triggers and analog sticks feel and precision. the triggers have a new rumble feel while in use for shooters and driving games for tension. the triggers are more slanted upward giving them a awkward feeling and will take some time getting used to. as for the tile interface that you get from windows 8 is something that 20% of the world knows how to use and is easy to get used to. but for others that are not used to. it can be a bit confusing. the system has its goods and bads and no one needs a new console at lunch expecting a lot out of the system. these nex gen systems need time and work to really make the end user get that this is a new nex gen system feeling. it takes time and great developer's to make that leap and develope only on these next gen systems before we feel that next gen feeling. overall I give the xbox one a 3.5 out of 5",

So I had to convert it to a PDF in order for her to view it, but she couldn't edit, so we had to do that \"manually\".

I am very impressed with the voice commands. It hears commands even when I am stuffing my face with food. I can almost get rid of my remote. The one thing you can not control is the DVR function on your cable box, I have Comcast. I have read that the control of your DVR along with the ability to record 4 shows at once is coming .\nThe Kenect is soooo above the old one. It reads your pulse from the vein in your neck and can tell the difference between an open and closed hand. It also comes with many free fitness programs.\nThe only problems I have had are the controller eats batteries pretty fast and I had a couple of minor lockup problems that required pulling the power plug and doing a cold re-boot. However I have not had a single problem since the last update.",

Gameplay and graphics are stunning, the controller is perfect, and the kinect is great! The game selection is also superior to playstation. Halo remains the exclusive flagship for the console while Xbox was also able to bring in former playstation exclusives such as FFXV and Kingdom Hearts. Overall well worth the extra price. The only drawbacks are the size and the lack of immediate backward capability (which ps4 also lacks).",

        "comment": "Where do I start? I got this for my business so when my kids were with me at work they would have something to do. I went with this instead of the PS4 hoping to eliminate the need for TV service and not have a computer. And Xbox One is supposed to be able to do everything. I go the Lego Movie game for it as the first game due to the lack of age appropriate games for my sons. It looks amazing. I go to set up my Netflix, YouTube, etc. and find out that you need an Xbox Live Gold account to access anything online. I do remember hearing about this when the console came out, but didn't pay much attention to it. My bad, I guess, but it's ridiculous. I got the Gold membership. Got online. I couldn't figure out how to go to the App store, or marketplace or whatever it's called. I wanted to see if they had the March Madness Live app so I could watch the tournament while I was at work. After 3 days of searching the internet to try to find out how to download apps, having every kid who came into my barbershop between the ages of 7-16 try to find the apps, I had given up. A nice man from Game Stop came in and after an hour of trying to find it, called his friend and was advised to turn off the console and reset it. Finally, the app store was on the screen! Yay! But boo!...No March Madness app. Really? for the console that can do everything? Yes, really. I checked the CBS website to see if I could watch it online using the Xbox One. Nope! No flash player on the Xbox One. What the heck? What is this, an iPad? Oh wait, the iPad has the March Madness app. So the iPad/iPhone doesn't support flash, but at least on those devices, you can view almost anything on their wide selection of apps. The ESPN app is decent, but not for actually watching games-only highlights and sports center... Someone had to tell me how to back out of the internet, because it has no instruction manual. The online support is horrible... I haven't had a Microsoft/Windows product since 1999 and this thing is not sweetening the deal for me to switch back. It seems to play any game, you have to sign in to at least one thing. To play NBA 2K14, you have to put in your birthdate to play a \"quick game\", which is anything but quick to start actually playing it. Nobody who has been in age 7-30 can figure out how to play a 2 player 2K14 game. If kids aged 12-18 can't figure this out, how do you think a 39 year old man who rarely plays video games is going to figure it out? And several of said 2K14 players have it for PS4. Both controllers are powered on and able to control the Xbox in some way. Just not as an actual controller for the game you want to play. That being said, the graphics are unbelievable. My kids LOVE Titanfall, they say it's the best game they've ever played, and I was very reluctant to buy it because they are only 9 and 10 and I'm a huge prude when it comes to violent video games. My last complaint is the lack of games appropriate for pre-tweens. I let them play on Xbox Live but only without a headset or mic. I've heard recordings of what kids their age say to each other on these games and it would embarrass Andrew Dice Clay.",

I had a family member convince me to get the MacBook Air and I am SO GLAD I did. For what I use it for (school work, social media, e-mail, basic web browsing) it's perfect. The size and weight is extremely portable and it is so comfortable while sitting on your lap, not to mention it's silent. I cannot hear any noise from the computer running what so ever. Doesn't noticeably overheat while running. The battery life is AMAZING, It definitely gets you at least 10 hours, when I have the screen dimmed about half-way it gets the full 11.5-12 hours on one charge, and it only takes about a half hour to charge completely from an empty battery. I would HIGHLY recommend this for anyone considering the two, I am in love. I have had this for over a month, and I still am amazed by it every day. First Mac owned. Apple iPhone &amp; iPad user also.",

        "comment": "After waiting it out a few months I finally broke down and purchased an Xbox One. I have also purchased Forza 5, NBA2K14, COD Ghosts , Dead Rising 3,and Titanfall. Out of these games, Forza 5 and NBA2K14 look great, but are just ok otherwise, and COD and Dead Rising don't look or play much different than their current gen counterparts. Titanfall on the other hand hasn't come out of the console since it went in, and is so fun that it may justify the purchase of the console on its own.\nAs far as the system interface itself, my main gripe is the occasionally over sensitive Kinect functions. It will sometimes tell me the controller is disconnected if I move to a seat that isn't directly in front of it. Or it will think I attempted a motion prompt when I didn't. Minor gripes, and not frequent, but can be annoying at times.\nI do like how you can switch between TV, Apps, Games, and so on quickly while keeping them running in the background so that you can go back to them with little to no loading. I also like how I was able to feed my DirecTV DVR box through the console, thereby giving it voice controls and a little more functionality.\nOverall, I would recommend the system with the disclaimer that the game library is currently somewhat limited, and that there are some glitches that could potentially be patched with system updates.",

We have our Comcast cable box hooked through its HDMI IN port, and it set up the channel lineup quickly enough. My fiancee has been playing Call of Duty Ghosts, Battlefield 4, and Titanfall on it, and, in the case of the former two, she can see the added graphic quality over the 360. The voice control seems to respond better to me than to her, though, and sometimes requires me to speak somewhat forcefully. Of course, I have to turn the console on if I want to watch TV, but that's as easy as saying, \"Xbox on! Xbox, watch TV! Stop listening!\" (And, when done: \"Xbox, go home! Xbox, turn off! Yes!\") She's quite satisfied with the console, and I look forward to seeing what else Microsoft will do with it.",

        "comment": "This is an excellent system. I would give it 5 stars if it supported 3D playback like the PS3. MS mentioned supporting this feature in the future, but we will have to wait for the update if this is true. Games play well and the controller is fantastic. However, like any launch lineup, there needs to be more AAA must-have titles. So far, Titanfall and MGSV Ground Zeroes are great, but games that take full advantage of the system's power are on the horizon, so will have to be patient from that aspect. Backwards compatibility would have been nice to help facilitate the transition to this system, especially when there are several months between the next wave of games in the Fall. However, the platform does well integrating TV and other services to help feature the system as a centerpiece for your living room. So the tradeoff benefits outweigh the shortfalls of backwards compatibility (IMO), just means I have to hold on to my 360 a little longer. Kinect 2.0 is a nice feature as well, but sometimes has issues recognizing voice commands if the room is not totally quiet. I'm sure this will/can be fixed with a future update. Overall, a great system!",

        "comment": "I have been an Xbox owner since the first Xbox released. I have had no problems at all with the Xbox live service, and of course there was the incident with the Xbox 360 involving the RROD. In time Microsoft has fixed this issue.\n\nFor the XboxOne, the Xbox Live is still the great service it is known for. Currently though the 360 is still holding strong to it's life support while there are very few games for the One. And with Microsoft now attempting to take over the entire entertainment aspect of your home, it still has a few issues to fix.\n\nThe Kinect works as a voice recognition at the moment and doesn't really utilize much games, only a few. Kinect Sports, Xbox Fitness. And you get the option to use it to maneuver your way through the Home menu. The motion sensor is still (in my opinion) an add-on that should not be required. When the Nintendo Wii utilized the remote sensor to pick up multiple parties on screen, it was best used for those party games. And currently it's not holding up well for this beginning release whilst game developers are still in the process of making a fun game to use with the Kinect. In short, the Kinect should be a stand-alone peripheral. Getting it now, MIGHT be cheaper for the long run, but I wouldn't think so.\n\nAs for the One itself, their Windows interface is lacking. The previous Home Menu on the 360 was easier to move through. This feels as if I am trying to use a PC interface with my controller/motin sensor/voice commands. Your settings option is very limited in comparison to the 360 (unable to DELETE demos, NOT just uninstall. Why are you making me KEEP these items on here if I'm only using them once?) You don't have major customization as you did with the 360 (Themes, custom backgrounds. You only get a small palette of color choices for the squares). You can pin and unpin your favorites, which again feels like it's a PC. The home menu/interface feels like a downgrade from the 360. It doesn't feel as welcoming as before.\n\nThe console itself is silent, it's a huge beast of a console but it's sleek design is great. It can also be used to display your cable tv. It has multiple outputs in the back that allows you to watch TV so that you have one device/control taking care of it all. I personally have no use for it. If I wanted cable, I have my OWN cable box from the cable company I signed up with.\n\nI use my Xbox One to play games. And that's what I think a console, ALL CONSOLES, should remain as. I am a fan of Xbox Live and I have been a member for over 10 years. I hope the future updates will change all of my issues.\n\nI would recommend... just NOT YET.",

        "comment": "The Xbox One is the subject of much debate in the gaming community as of late. Why? From first hand accounts it is all due to either the mere existence of the Kinect, Microsoft's E3 conference, or some strange emotional attachment to the console's competition.\n\nWhat is the truth throughout all this grandstanding? The Xbox One is a good console, full stop. Is it the greatest? It would be silly to make that assumption for any console. It is good though.\n\nThe UI is clean and very reminiscent of Windows 8 (the system does actually run a version of the Windows 8 OS so that is expected), and the Kinect's voice commands really revolutionize the way one interacts with their media devices. The voice commands are very easy to memorize and actually quite versatile in that each option on screen can potentially be controlled by name simply by calling it out in the proper way. This means that for non-gaming use you can get by perfectly without having to turn your controller on.\n\nOf course, there is a certain camp that insists the voice commands are not reliable, but that is simply not true. For example, it works about as well as Apple's Siri. If you speak with a heavy accent, play loud music, or have people talking over you, of course the voice recognition won't recognize you. The Kinect is designed to pick up a specific type of voice and accent; because of this, English(US) and English(UK) are separate options. Everything else is fair game, and if there are any issues, you can re-calibrate the Kinect's microphone within seconds to account for a noisy room.\n\nThe exclusive games are quality so far. Dead Rising 3 can simply be described as raunchy, rude fun (and everything that moniker entails with a few shocking extras not safe for work). Ryse is a simple but addictive game with surprisingly deep combat, I highly recommend checking out the co-op multiplayer. Titanfall is probably the cream of the crop concerning modern shooters. The downloadable games are quality as well, with games like Peggle 2 for casual play and Halo Spartan Assault for quick co-op games with your friends.\n\nAs for what the future holds for the console, that is anyone's guess but what is already available is nothing to sneeze at. I say do some research first then take the plunge if what you see tickles your fancy.",

        "comment": "So far, as one of the two titans of console gaming launch into the market, the Xbox One has a fully realized system of integrating your entire entertainment life into one fairly easy to use hub of operations. Its voice activated system, which may seem gimmicky and Jetsonian at first, quickly evolves into a highly usable (albeit sometimes finicky) system, especially if you're like me and lose your remote in the couch cushions more often than not. Only time, and eventual updates and exclusive game releases will tell the full story of who wins this next iteration of the console gaming wars; but if you're lucky enough to be able to choose a next gen console and want a fully realized system that consolidates your streaming services, cable television and gaming preferences all in one centralized location, the Xbox One is a good choice as a foray into the next level of gaming devices.",

The battery lasts for many hours more than any of my previous pcs/laptops. I was skeptical to buy apple products because of price and the perception I had that I had to buy any/all accessories through Apple (price again), but my daughter asked for an iPad for XMas and it was great, easy and very convenient to use. We also have a kindle fire and while it can somewhat be compared, the iPad is definitely better in my opinion. She than got a MacPro for school and I fell in love with it so I retired my windows laptop (thing needed to be plugged to outlet after 40 min and it was a bit more than a year old). The only con is having to learn all new commands.",

        "comment": "Gaming:4/5\nOf the games I have played so far (Ryse, Dead Rising 3 and Titanfall) they are pretty good. The first two mentioned make decent and intuitive choices with the voice commands, making integrating them for the average player simple and fun. The multiplayer service is decent but at this time I have seen no evidence to think that the service itself has improved vastly, even with a 6x greater connection than what I had with previous consoles.\n\nController: 5/5\nAbsolutely fantastic. Feels good in the hand, has a faster boot time than the 360 controller (about a second or so) and battery life seems to be excellent.\n\nKinect: 3.5/5\nThey did a good job with the Kinect. Better than the last round (360) but still - not perfect. The voice commands work about 95% of the time and the gestures don't really work at all. Have yet to try a Kinect enabled game yet (outside of voice commands), so this score could change.\n\nXbox Live: 3/5\nThe service is still as dull and bland as ever. With any new console at launch, especially in the digital age - there isn't a lot of content. Perusing the store is uninteresting as there is really only 10-15 titles to view, with only the corresponding DLC to mix things up. I find little drive to connect with friends on-line, even in multiplayer games. The achievement system with rewards is interesting, but ultimately has been under-promoted and not been utilized by me, despite my 60,000+ gamerscore.\n\nOther: 5/5\nFunnily enough, this is where the Xbox One really shines. It does many thing very well. The streaming from PC to Xbox is pretty good (videos), and the smartglass features are truly a good addition to the consoles already very accessible functionality. Netflix and Hulu Plus perform better and with more reliability (plus in Ultra HD) on the Xbox One than on any PC I have used. The interface is slick and easy to read. The ability to hook our satellite box to the Xbox (effectively turning my satellite box into a voice-controlled machine) with a more attractive and easier to use channel guide than what Direct TV provides for their own machine is in a word: Awesome.\n\nOverall 20.5/25 (82%)\nIn many ways the Xbox again is leading the industry in intuitive access, in-home entertainment and aesthetic design. Unfortunately, the Xbox One only receives a B as it's gaming merits really are untested to this point (as far as exclusivity goes) and there are some functions that seem less functional and more frustrating. However, it is a good machine and Titanfall is a fantastically fun game on the One. Here's to hoping it only gets better.",

There are not a lot of games at the time of the system's release but the games that are out so far are great. The Xbox One goes from watching TV to playing games seamlessly. The connect system is also intergraded much better than it was within the Xbox 360. The user interface within the game is customizable and also integraded very well. Eventhough I have only had the systme for only a few days I have had no issues with the system.\nI think this system will not have the same problems that the Xbox 360 had with the red ring of death. I think this system is built on a better architecture structure and I would definitely recommend this system as not only a gaming system but also an overall multimedia device.\n\nAs far as games are concerned Forza and Battlefield 4 are perfect games for this system and I don't think I have turned off the system since I've gotten it.\n\nThank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.",

Not yet anyway. What is frustrating is the controller issues are still ongoing. Loss of signal. You need the light on the controller to be solid for it to work. If it is flashing you have to move your controller around to find the signal. Frustrating when you are playing a game. Hopefully updates will fix this.",

I have had Issues with the controllers to the point of not being able to play due to sync issues. I got so mad i broke one. The TV mode sucks it is basically just a redirection of your cable but you lose all options you have with cable box. The famous 100$ more you pay for the Kinect does not work. Omg I went through a set up for it and it is worthless. you can only say predetermined commands that are all different. then you say them and it cant understand you anyway. I repeat my self about 4-5 times before it will work. I even had friends try nope nothing. I cant even give the controller a good rating because it does not sync with the xbox. The games are good but they look better at higher definition on the PS4. The Xbox one just feels like it was a rushed system that is still not done. The PS4 was perfect out of box. The last xbox 360 went dead with ring of death so I give them one more try and this is what I get? I still have original PS3 and it works great. I will never buy another Xbox again.",

The design of the console itself results in the lowest heat output I've seen in a console in the past decade. The interface is great. The Kinect works great, and is well integrated into every facet of the system. This helps reduce controller battery use, when voice commands reduce the necessity of the controller during video playback, including Hulu and Netflix.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "This will be a quick review of my personal experiences with the MacBook Air. I have had this laptop for about a year and still love it. It has 4th Gen Intel Core processors, Intel HD Graphics 5000, Wi-Fi support, Thunderbolt and USB 3 ports, a 720p HD webcam, and operates using OS X. The MacBook Air has a high-resolution 13.3\u201d screen that possesses excellent brightness even in direct sunlight. This is all wrapped up into a good looking, thin, and lightweight platform.\nAlthough I like this laptop a lot, there are a few minor flaws to note. Battery life is not the best. Apple claims up to twelve hours of battery life on the 13.3\u201d screen model but I have yet to get anywhere close to that. While in use I average around five or six hours of battery life. Another drawback to the MacBook Air is the lack of an internal disk drive. I do have the external disk drive from Apple that works great but it can be a bit of a hassle to have to carry around as well. The final flaw I have to note is the fact that there is only one USB port. I do not consider this a major problem as you can just plug in a USB splitter, but once again that is something you will have to tote around.\nNow I will mention the upsides of the MacBook Air. There are a lot of great features that the Air possesses so I will just hit what I believe to be the highlights. First off, as with any Apple product, it is extremely easy to use. The interface is very well laid out, straight forward, and easy to use. Also, if you have an iPod, iPhone, or any other Apple device it is easy to sync them together. The MacBook Air is loaded with standard features and gives you the ability to adapt it to fit your personal needs.\nAs I mentioned above, the screen is excellent. Even if you are in direct sunlight, the screen is still very visible. The backlit keyboard is great if you are working in a dark environment. Apple did an outstanding job of packing so much into such a small package. The whole computer is only about a half of an inch thick at the widest point with the length and width not being much larger than the screen itself. The computer also has a durable metal exterior but still retains being lightweight.\nThis computer is the total package. There are a few minor drawbacks to the MacBook Air as I mentioned earlier, but nothing that would prevent me from recommending it to a friend. By no means is this a cheap computer, but you would be hard pressed to find a better one for the money. I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for high quality, easy to use, and dependable computer. My rating for the MacBook Air is a solid five stars.",

However when i first opened the system and turned it on, i went to insert the game disk and it just would not go in. it was the whole disk drive not functioning properly. I immediately went online to see if anyone else has this problem as well and it turns out it is actually something wrong with the system itself and the whole thing needs to be unplugged and started up again. sure enough this actually worked and things were good for awhile. Next the microphone that comes with the system was not functioning properly as well. depending on which day i plugged it into the controller it would not pick up others talking or some days would not pick up on my voice. after a few days the whole mic stopped working and once again i looked to see if it was a common problem and many people are experiencing thing too. The system is good and i am happy i got it but for something to be this advanced and BRAND NEW i am disappointed with problems such as these. For the price it should be close to perfect.",

        "comment": "You can easily peruse the web for details about what makes this phone great. The hardware is ridiculous, and is the main reason I bought it...2GB RAM with dual 1.5GHz processors. It's slimmer than I imagined and lighter than my previous Droid Razr, but doesn't feel cheap. The new OS (Android 4.0 ICS) is really nice with a bunch of great features, like keeping track of your data usage from the phone, instead of what VZW captures, and then shutting off data at a preset limit. I wish some of the new features were more configurable, like the widgets built into the pulldown status bar. Of course, it's a smartphone, so don't expect great battery life, out of the box...although ICS has a nice feature to show battery life percentage remaining. I run though about 10% battery life every hour (about 10-15 minutes of straight usage, 45-50 minutes standby).\n\nSeriously, the only gripe I have is that the volume keys on the left and the power button on the right are in bad positions. Virtually every time I press the power button (one-handed use), I accidentally change my volume settings...and vice versa, I'm accidentally pressing the power button when I just want to change the volume.\n\nI have yet to root this one, but I hear it can be done, even with the locked bootloader. Not sure if I need to, though.\n\nMy rating: 4.8 (I rounded up to 5 for the star rating)\n\nGo get it, it's worth every bit of $200 (or $250 for the 32GB version).",

My only gripe is that the screen, especially in direct sun, is less than ideal, due to the AMOLED screen. These screens just don't get quite as bright as LCD.

        "comment": "The S3 is a great device that packs countless features into a slim design. Despite its thin appearance, the phone feels substantial and comfortable when in use. I purchased mine in pebble blue, and the color is both attractive and unique. It\u2019s something that must be seen in person to truly appreciate.\n\nIn terms of hardware specs, I\u2019ve had no disappointments. The only concern I had was battery life, but even then, my worries were put to rest when I realized that I could easily pull off an entire day\u2019s worth of usage without needing to scramble for an outlet. Transitioning to a \u201ctrue 4G\u201d phone, battery life was a primary concern, however the S3 manages to get through an entire day of moderate use with auto brightness and constant LTE connectivity. I live in SoCal and Verizon has definitely proved that its network is capable of providing top extremely reliable call quality and amazing data speeds. In practice, I\u2019ve been getting download speeds ranging from 20-30 mb/s with upload speeds easily going above 12 mb/s. In contrast, I was never even close to approaching those type of speeds on my HTC G2 running on T-mobile\u2019s HSPA+ network. With a 1.5ghz dual core processor and 2gbs of ram, the S3 phone provides an extremely fluid experience that is absent of any lag. It offers snappy performance and the phone never seems reluctant to perform a task.\n\nAnother factor that I took into consideration when searching for a phone was its camera. The S3\u2019s camera is extremely fast and capable. It\u2019ll be more than adequate for social networking websites and can even be deemed good enough to print. The camera\u2019s software features a menu that is very well laid out and can even be customized.\n\nVenturing deeper into the S3\u2019s software, let\u2019s not forget that this phone is running ICS with Samsung\u2019s skin on top. Samsung has gone through great lengths to show people that the S3\u2019s design was inspired by nature, and it reflects quite heavily in its software. Unlocking its screen and coming into contact with the device will reveal noises that mimic the sound of both flowing and dripping water. In addition to that, I was pleasantly surprised to wake up to sounds of nature and the outdoors for the default alarm clock. Overall, the S3 features what you would expect in a typical Android 4.0 device. Navigating through apps and menus is fairly simple, and with a screen this impressive, it makes things much more pleasing. The screen is simply remarkable, especially in it\u2019s reproduction of blacks. It\u2019s crisp and it features colors that I\u2019ve never witnessed on any other handset.\n\nThe features that Samsung includes with this phone also enhanced my experience. Smart stay for example, which monitors a viewers face before timing out the display has actually proven to be quite useful. S-beam works perfectly for transferring photos. Other than that, I haven\u2019t really tried it on any other type of file, although it seems very promising. My only complaint would probably be the accuracy of S-voice. It works for the most part, especially for simple tasks, however, it easily gets words confused, which then requires several trials to get things right. Other than that, the rest of Samsung\u2019s S-features are quite useful.\n\nOverall, the S3 is an amazing phone that never fails to satisfy. It\u2019s speed and power are hard to match and it\u2019s unique blend of nature inspired hardware and software help set it apart from competitors.",

Also with 4G LTE speeds this phone is a beast.\nCall and sound quality are great too. In fact, the only negative thing I can say is that S-Voice is as bad or worse than Siri #both are overated pieces of software that have too many glitches for my liking).\nSamsung hit it out of the park with this phone.

        "comment": "At first I was absolutely in love with my S3. There is never any lag to be found, whether you're swiping through home screens or playing the latest games. The camera quality is excellent and takes pictures much faster than previous phones I've owned. I've always been rather impressed with the battery for the most part, as it lasts a full day easily. Things aren't all perfect, however. Within a few days of owning my first S3 I began experiencing a \"No Sim\" error. This would cause the current text I was attempting to send, or the phone call I was trying to make, to fail. The issue only happened once or twice a day at first, so I ignored it, thinking it was simply a fluke or a tower issue. A few days later I continued having it, and decided to exchange my phone for another S3. Within several hours of firing up my second S3 I began having the same problem. I had my SIM card swapped out, thinking it could possibly be a bad SIM card, but still, no cigar. It has been roughly two weeks since I swapped phones, and I am now having the problem several times a day. The issue only happens when you attempt to send a text or call, making it especially frustrating, as it interrupts whatever you are doing. As much as I love the hardware behind this phone, I am finding it hard to justify as my primary phone, as it can hardly function as that. I'm hoping this issue is fixed, otherwise Samsung will find this thing floating around on Ebay, as I will gladly go back to an older phone.",

It has a top notch camera, great processor and even better on Verizon's 4g lte network you can surf the web and watch videos at the snap of a finger. The only problem I have had with the phone has been here and there, there will be a small bit of lag. Other then that the phone is the best on the market and in my opinion better then the 4s. Only thing the 4s beats the SIII in is the voice recognition. Other then that the IPhone is light years behind in my opinion. The phone is a must buy!!",

The iPhone 4 consistently had 3 more bars than the Samsung III. Bottom line - the iPhone had much better reception from the same carrier.\n\nYour location is critical.",

        "comment": "Nice phone with a lot of features. It is light weight and the screen is top notch. But, if you use your phone on the go with the need to make calls and navigate the screens with one hand, not so good. While big is great for watching videos and such, this screen makes it cumbersome to handle one handed. I am a very big man with big hands and even I found myself having to stretch my thumbs to activate widgets on screen. The number of steps to perform certain tasks were too many. To return a missed call, I had to touch the phone button, then touch the missed call button, then had to select between the call icon or the message icon, then had to hit the call button to actually start the call. Wow, what a lot to do to call someone back. I returned the phone and will likely go back to my former vendor. Pretty nice phone if you sit around, with two hands and a lot of time on those hands to play with your phone. Otherwise it's too much like an undersized tablet for those of us on the go.",

I'd also like to know who decided to put the on/off button on the side of the phone opposite the volume button. When you try to shut your screen off, you end up pushing the volume button.

        "comment": "This is my first smart phone. There are no user guides, no CDs. You're on your own. I don't like that. There are too many things to learn without having a detailed guide. I want a manual that tells me all the options and how to use each one. Instead, I have to go to You Tube just to learn how to access my voice mail or a call waiting. The phone is good; it has a lot of features but it is hard to learn how to use all of them. And the first bill was like a bait and switch. I was charged activation fees, change of number fees, 411 fees, and pro rated monthly fees, none of which was I apprised about when I purchased the phone. They said it would be between $140-160 per month with no hidden charges. When all these charges appeared, I couldn't believe it. I had to call Verizon and even then, they only removed the change number fees. When this contract is over, I'm going back to the prepaid flip phones. At least, there, I know exactly what I'm paying. Oh, and by the way, the texting is attrocious! Every time you enter a letter, some stupid word comes up and you have to constantly tap their suggestion of what you want to write, erase it, erase the space it created and try to retext what you originally wanted. It is ridiculously time consuming and so stupid.",

Then I asked myself \"Why 'upgrade' to a phone with a 4\" screen and features that I've enjoyed on the phone I'm replacing for the past 2 years?\"\nAfter seeing the S3 in person I was sold. This is a mammoth of a phone, but it is thin even with a case. The size may be too large for some users, but I think it's perfect for viewing photos, content, and all around eas of navigation. I enjoy the large, crisp AMOLED screen, multitasking, the gestures are flat out awesome, and overall the battery life is better than my Fascinate. Smartphones in general, however, are in need of some sort of battery revolution.\nI purchased the 16 gig S3 for cheaper than the iPhone 5 (and without a wait.) I poped my 16 gig microSD card in and suddenly had double the space. If I had to pick a flaw with this phone, it's that I wish the front facing camera took better quality photos. The rear camera is excellent, but the front doesn't seem to do as well in low light situations.\nBe sure to pick up an S3 at a great price! It's an excellent value with impressive specs which are certainly futureproof.",

Has nice large display, beautiful screen, phone features are easy to use, overall love the phone.\n\nMy biggest beef is that the call quality is not as good a my HTC. Never had any issues with the phone at my house, where the reception is a little weak, but now I experience cutouts on calls fairly consistently. The other annoying thing is that occasionally the phone freezes when I am doing something. Have not been able to figure out why. I use a hard rubber case, and I wonder if it is because I push some combination of keys accidentally. Can't reset it except for taking the battery out.\n\nIf you can live with those 2 annoying things, this is a great phone.",

        "aboutMe": [], 
        "comment": "I am having trouble finding anything negative to say about this phone. I have been singing its praises to everyone I meet since I bought it 5 days ago. I went from a 1st generation Motorola Droid to this, and have since said that didn't realize just how much I wanted a new phone until I got a new phone. The Galaxy S3 doesn't really do much of anything that the Droid couldn't do (except the S-Beam feature, which I have yet to use). It just does EVERYTHING better and faster. Much better... and much, much faster.\n\nI was worried about the size, but it actually feels very comfortable in my hand (I have average sized hands for a man). The light weight and slim profile are great, and the size and shape are not so big that I can't fit it in my pocket (shirt or pant). I don't like holsters, so it will always be in a pocket for me.\n\nThe AMOLED display and Gorilla Glass touch screen are incredibly responsive (almost too much so... I sometimes find it difficult to use the keyboards because if I don't pick up my finger quickly enough, it will register the key next to the one I pressed - even tho my finger is no longer physically in contact with the screen).\n\nThe Samsung designers have a done a great job with the UI. The Notifications panel is very well laid out and has shortcuts and instant activation icons for so many tasks that I used to have to search through menus to find. The widget and Home panel layout is also very user friendly and intuitive.\n\nThe camera is quite good. It rivals any inexpensive dedicated digital camera for functionality and picture quality (IMO), and its controls are also fairly intuitive.\n\nOne gripe I do have is that the battery, while very good (especially considering everything I have been asking the phone to do over the last several days) is not all it was advertised as. The reviews and promotional info that I had read claimed a 22 hour battery life, and while I have not yet had to recharge it mid-day, I can't see it going 22 hours... maybe 18-20 at my usage pace. Now, to be fair... it has several power saving settings and features that I have mostly set to OFF, so perhaps if I was a bit more conservative about my approach, 22 hours would be realistic.\n\nThe S-Voice feature appears to work fine. I had heard that it wasn't up to the same standard as Apple's Siri, but I've never owned an iPhone, so I have no real frame of reference for a comparison. I do find that S-Voice works MUCH better than the voice recognition on my old phone.\n\nSound quality on the calls thus far has been adequate to above average. Not perfect, but more than satisfactory. No dropped calls yet and my listeners have told me that I sound much clearer than I did on my Droid.\n\nSo there you have it. I had to reach to find anything bad to say about it. The 4G-LTE is lightning fast (about 8 times faster on average than my high-speed internet wi-fi at home), and the price was fair and reasonable. Overall, it has been one of the best purchases I've made in quite some time.\n\nI love this phone. Just love it.",

Even my high school senior nephew couldn't get our phones to share. If a teenager can't do it, no wonder two senior citizens can't figure it out, nor could the Verizon trainer at the workshop.

I've read a lot of gripes about battery life, but it is VERY good compared to my old phone. It is the one area, however, where the iPhone is still ahead. For everything else (especially speed, screen size and clarity) I am still impressed with this phone and have had it almost 6 months. The glass is still as flawless as when it came out of the box. Buy this phone and there will be no question as to why Apple has gone after Samsung so viciously.",

I put a 25 GB card in it so have lots of storage room for pictures, music, documents and books. The screen is really responsive, almost too much so sometimes! I did put the zagg shield on it and an otter box commander so that it will be protected as it was very slippery. Everything that I use runs so much easier and faster on this phone. I was worried about the call quality as we live in a rural area but it has been great, and music sounds wonderful on it. I haven't figured everything out yet but love the fact that it is like having a computer with me. It also works well with my Galaxy tab 2. The Samsung calendar syncs between them so I am always up to date.",

It is easy to maneuver through the apps and settings and that's fantastic. One thing that I have trouble with is when I'm texting it is easy to hit a button that wants to insert unwanted pics, smileys, links and I'm not sure what I am hitting that keeps doing that. Would definitely recommend this phone to anyone looking - so glad I picked it instead of an iphone!!",

I'm not a tech geek. And I don't text or surf or play games or send videos. Primary reason for buying: larger photo display and better resolution than my cell phone, access my email, search the web. Give me my old cell phone for phone calls: the touch screen for phone contacts and making calls is so sensitive that I have to be sure I'm calling the right person. The worst thing about it is I have to have a case and carry it or wear it on my belt. Why? Because just the movement of my pants against the screen activates it and it keeps \"blipping\" until I remove it. Can this be addressed? Maybe, but as yet I didn't go searching on the web to find out. My fault: yes. But you wanted my opinion so here it is.",

The GS3 is just the perfect size phone; larger screen than the iPhone5 but still fits into my pants pocket without an issue. The GS3 is much thinner too, so even with the Urban Armor Gear composite case I added, it's just the right size to fit comfortably in my hand. I was pleasantly suprised by the better sound quality on both sides of the call. Another plus is the standard battery that comes with the GS3 has a longer life than I expected (2-3 days between charges). This phone is so loaded with features, it will take you a while just to try them all out yet. I've had my GS3 for two months now, and it still impresses me!",

        "comment": "This is my first smart phone. I learned to use its many features right away. I find the phone outstanding with only 2 problems. Accuweather in the main home, screen mistakes my city regularly even though I have the GPS enabled and at times the wind chill factor is higher than the actual temp. What a difference when compared with The Weather Chanell. Second problem: in my wife's iPhone it's very easy to look up a definition of a word in a text, either an article from the Internet or from an email. I have not been able to do it on my phone. I'd be happy",

I don't like the battery life, but if you clear out your task manager and memory daily, the battery will last longer.",
